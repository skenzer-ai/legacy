# Proxie Agent - Service Enhancement Automation System

## Overview

Proxie is an intelligent AI agent designed to collaborate with users to understand, test, and enhance API endpoints within the Man-O-Man platform. Unlike traditional rule-based systems, Proxie uses LLM-powered analysis to provide comprehensive service enhancement automation.

## Core Mission

- **Understand APIs Better**: Analyze complete API endpoint objects from parsed OpenAPI specifications
- **Intelligent Testing**: Generate appropriate test parameters and execute live API calls
- **Service Enhancement**: Create meaningful descriptions and metadata for improved service discovery
- **Quality Assurance**: Flag problematic APIs and suggest service improvements
- **Automation Ready**: Prepare services for production usage and automation workflows

## Technical Architecture

### Agent Type
**Hybrid Autonomous Agent with User Checkpoints**
- Background autonomy for bulk processing and analysis
- Foreground interaction for critical decisions and approvals
- Smart escalation when complex scenarios require user input

### Positioning
**Service-Centric Enhancement Orchestrator**
- Operates at service level, not individual API testing level
- Dedicated enhancement interface separate from testing tools
- Integrated with existing Man-O-Man service registry

## Enhancement Pipeline

### 1. Service Selection
- Triggered via "Enhance with Proxie" button on service cards
- Batch processing capabilities for multiple services
- Priority-based queue for enhancement requests

### 2. Deep Analysis Phase
- **OpenAPI Specification Analysis**: Parse complete endpoint objects including examples, schemas, descriptions
- **Parameter Intelligence**: Extract available examples and response patterns from API documentation
- **Service Context Building**: Understand relationships between APIs within the service
- **Cross-Service Pattern Recognition**: Learn from previously enhanced services

### 3. Live Testing Phase
- **Parameter Strategy Generation**: Create multiple parameter combinations based on available examples
- **Authentication Handling**: Use configured proxy settings for live API calls
- **Response Analysis**: Analyze API responses for schema validation and behavior patterns
- **Error Pattern Recognition**: Identify common failure modes and parameter issues

### 4. Pattern Recognition & Quality Assessment
- **CRUD Pattern Detection**: Identify standard create, read, update, delete operations
- **Service Coherence Analysis**: Evaluate if APIs belong together or should be split
- **Quality Scoring**: Assess API documentation quality and functionality
- **Automation Readiness**: Determine suitability for automated workflows

### 5. Enhancement Generation
- **Description Creation**: Generate clear, contextual descriptions for APIs and services
- **Metadata Enhancement**: Add fields like automation_difficulty, business_criticality, workflow_role
- **Service Restructuring Suggestions**: Recommend service splits or merges
- **API Flagging**: Mark problematic APIs with specific issues and recommendations

### 6. User Approval Workflow
- **Tier 1 Services**: Single approval after analyzing all APIs in the service
- **Tier 2 Services**: Individual approval required for each API enhancement
- **Batch Operations**: Multiple service approvals with summary review

### 7. Registry Updates & Notifications
- **Service Registry Updates**: Save enhanced descriptions and metadata
- **Dashboard Notifications**: Alert users to completed enhancements
- **Progress Tracking**: Maintain enhancement status across all services

## State Management & Memory

### Service Enhancement Workspace
- **Per-Service State**: Maintain analysis progress and findings for each service
- **Session Context**: Track API testing results and parameter patterns within service
- **Cross-Service Learning**: Remember successful patterns and apply to future enhancements
- **User Preference Memory**: Learn from user approval/rejection patterns

### Collaboration Memory
- **Augment Agent Integration**: Store domain knowledge retrieved from Augment Agent
- **User Interaction History**: Remember user preferences for collaboration vs. autonomous work
- **Enhancement History**: Track successful enhancement patterns for reuse

## Collaboration Framework

### With Augment Agent
- **Domain Knowledge Requests**: "What is this service typically used for in ITSM?"
- **Best Practices Consultation**: "What are standard parameters for user management APIs?"
- **Related Information Gathering**: "Find documentation about this service's business context"

### With Users
- **Information Gathering**: Ask users for service context when documentation is insufficient
- **Decision Points**: Present clear options for service restructuring or API flagging
- **Approval Workflows**: Structured approval process with clear rationale for suggestions

### Smart Routing Strategy
1. **Try Available Documentation**: Use OpenAPI examples and descriptions first
2. **Consult Augment Agent**: Get domain-specific knowledge automatically
3. **Escalate to User**: Only when both previous methods are insufficient
4. **User Preference Override**: Allow users to set preferred collaboration mode

## User Interface Design

### Service Dashboard Integration
- **Enhancement Triggers**: "Enhance with Proxie" button on each service card
- **Progress Indicators**: Visual progress bars showing enhancement status
- **Quality Badges**: Display Proxie's quality assessments on service cards

### Dedicated Enhancement Dashboard
- **Active Enhancements**: Show services currently being processed by Proxie
- **Pending Approvals**: Queue of enhancements waiting for user approval
- **Enhancement History**: Complete log of Proxie's work across all services
- **System Insights**: Overall service registry health and improvement suggestions

### Approval Interface
- **Side-by-Side Comparison**: Original vs. enhanced descriptions
- **Rationale Display**: Clear explanation of why changes are suggested
- **Batch Approval**: Approve multiple related changes together
- **Feedback Mechanism**: Allow users to provide feedback on suggestion quality

## Advanced Capabilities

### Service Architecture Analysis
- **Service Cohesion Evaluation**: Determine if APIs logically belong together
- **Workflow Pattern Detection**: Identify common API usage sequences
- **Service Splitting Recommendations**: Suggest breaking large services into focused modules
- **API Relationship Mapping**: Understand dependencies and data flows between APIs

### Quality Assurance System
- **API Reliability Scoring**: Track success rates and response quality
- **Documentation Quality Assessment**: Evaluate completeness of API specifications
- **Parameter Validation**: Identify APIs with poor or missing parameter documentation
- **Response Schema Validation**: Verify actual responses match documented schemas

### Metadata Enhancement Engine
- **Automation Fields**: Add automation_difficulty, business_criticality, user_impact scores
- **Workflow Integration**: Tag APIs with their role in common ITSM workflows
- **Usage Context**: Identify primary use cases and user personas for each service
- **Integration Readiness**: Assess APIs for third-party integration capabilities

### Learning & Adaptation System
- **Pattern Library**: Build library of successful enhancement patterns
- **User Behavior Learning**: Adapt suggestions based on user approval patterns
- **Service Domain Intelligence**: Develop expertise in specific service domains (user management, asset tracking, etc.)
- **Continuous Improvement**: Refine enhancement strategies based on user feedback
