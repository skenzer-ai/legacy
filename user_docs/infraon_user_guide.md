### Asset Types

There are multiple types of assets in an organization. The first step of asset management is the categorization of assets. Broader categorization enables better management. The default categorization of assets within Infraon is as follows:

**Asset Type -> Asset Category -> Asset Sub-Category -> Asset**

The process of managing an asset depends on its type. Based on asset type, Infraon assets have been split into four modules.

**IT Assets** are physical assets or devices used in an organization's business activities that fall under the responsibility of IT staff. For example, computers, servers, routers, scanners, fax machines, printers, modems, hubs, and IoT (Internet of Things) devices.

**Fixed Assets** are any physical objects or vehicles you consider 'assets' to your organization. It can be easily converted into cash—for example, vehicles, machinery, equipment, etc.

**Consumables** are assets that organizations use. They must be replaced regularly because they wear out or are used up—for example, mouse devices, external keyboards, computer cables, printer toners, etc.

**Software Assets** are any functional software in an organization that requires service level agreement to ensure compliance with software licenses. For example, software assets may be internal or external, on-premises, or in the cloud.

Within these asset Types, assets are further classified into:

**Categories** – Categories are also referred to as 'parent' categories. A category is the first division of assets within the selected asset type. For example, within IT assets, there can be categories like laptops, desktops, etc.

**Sub-Categories** - Sub-categories are also referred to as child categories. The sub-category is the next level of asset division within the category. For example, if the categories are laptop or desktop, sub-categories within IT assets can be Dell, Lenovo, Apple, etc. Assets or asset items can be added here.

Refer to the [Asset Grid Page](/infraon-help/infinity-user-guide/asset/asset-grid-page) and [Asset Categories/Sub-Categories](/infraon-help/infinity-user-guide/asset/asset-categories-sub-categories) sections for details and instructions.

**Note:** Assets can be added at the category and sub-category levels. Regardless of the asset type, the steps to view, add, edit, and manage assets are the same.

#### Forecast

**Forecast** is a long-range capacity planning feature that analyzes historical performance data to project future trends over a **180-day rolling window**. It helps organizations proactively manage infrastructure by identifying when to **scale up or down resources** such as CPU, memory, disk, and **throughput**.

##### **How Forecast Is Created**

**Data Collection**

* A minimum of 14 days of historical performance data is required.
* 180 days is the standard data window for training the forecast model.

**Model Generation**

* Forecasting models are generated for each metric.
* Models are refreshed weekly (every Sunday) with a moving 180-day window.

**Model Type**

* Machine Learning models for time-series forecasting.
* Focused on performance metrics only (not availability metrics).
* Each model learns the behavior pattern and forecasts based on statistical trends.

##### **How it works**

Infraon’s Forecast uses intelligent algorithms to study past data and predict future trends. It looks at how a metric (like CPU or bandwidth usage) has behaved over time and tries to spot patterns.

The forecast shows a range using upper and lower lines (called bands) to give you a safe estimate of how things might go. The middle line is the expected value. You can also fine-tune forecasts using settings added in the terminologies below.

**Terminologies |** Forecast Details

| Label | Action | Description / Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Trend Analysis | Detects the overall direction of usage | Helps identify if resource usage is increasing, decreasing, or stable over time. |
| Seasonality | Finds repeating usage patterns | Spot regular patterns like higher usage during weekdays or business hours. |
| Change Point Detection | Flags sudden shifts in behavior | Detects when there is a significant change in the trend (e.g., after a software update). |
| Confidence Bands | Shows a safe prediction range | The forecast graph includes a range (upper & lower bands) with a center line for expected use. |
| Predicted Value | Calculates expected usage | The central point between the upper and lower bands is used for planning. |
| Change Point Scale | Adjusts sensitivity to changes | Higher value = model closely follows recent changes; lower = smoother trends. |
| Include History | Shows past data alongside forecast | Useful to compare how the system performed before and how it might behave going forward. |

##### **What do you see on the screen**

When you open the Forecast view, you'll see a line graph showing past and predicted values for a selected performance metric. The graph helps visualize how usage has behaved historically and how it’s expected to trend. Hovering over any point in the graph displays detailed forecast data for that timestamp.

**Basic Details |** Forecast

| Label | Action | Description / Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Polled | Displays past polled data | This is collected (raw) data from devices at periodic intervals (e.g., every hour). |
| Predicted | Displays forecast trend | Predicted future usage based on past patterns. |
| Grey Area | Shows forecast range | It covers the lower band to the upper band, representing the confidence range. |
| Upper Band | Forecast upper limit | Maximum possible usage at a given time based on model predictions. |
| Lower Band | Forecast lower limit | The minimum possible usage forecasted by the model. |
| Hover Preview | Shows details at a specific timestamp | View time, polled data, and forecast values (Upper, Predicted, Lower).Example:Time: 18th May, 2025 07:00 PMPolled Data: 5.50 %Upper Band: 6.47 %Predicted: 6.07 %Lower Band: 5.57 % |
| Filter | | |
| Current Month | Filter forecast to the current month only | From today's date to the end of the current month. |
| Next Month | Show forecast for the next whole month | For example, from June 1 to June 30. |
| Next 3 Months | View medium-term trend | Displays forecast for 90 days. |
| Next 6 Months | Show long-term usage prediction | Forecasts for up to 180 days into the future (maximum window). |

###### **Test Forecast**

The **Test Forecast** feature allows users to generate a **real-time forecast** by temporarily rebuilding the model using **customized settings**. This is especially useful when users want the estimates to reflect unique scenarios—such as holidays, maintenance windows, or unusual business cycles—where typical patterns may not apply.

**Test Forecast |** Basic Details

| Label | Action | Description / Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Business Hour Profile | Forecast only during business hours | Example: Monday–Friday, 09:00–18:00. Excludes weekends or custom time blocks. |
| Change Point Scale | Set model sensitivity | Range: 0.01 = underfit, 0.5 = overfit, 0.1 = balanced. |
| Include History | Toggle past data in the graph | Enables visual comparison of historical and forecast data. |
| Weekly Seasonal | Enable weekly pattern recognition | Helpful in detecting trends like high CPU usage every Monday. |
| Daily Seasonal | Enable intra-day pattern detection | Identifies time-of-day peaks, like lunch-hour bandwidth spikes. |

###### **Polled Data**

This table displays the historical values collected from the device or component at regular polling intervals. It helps users understand how the resource has performed over time.

| Label | Description / Example |
| --- | --- |
| Time | The exact timestamp when the data was collected (e.g., May 01, 2025 12:00 AM). |
| Value | The actual metric value now (e.g., 7.63%). |

###### **Forecasted Data**

This table displays the **predicted future values** for the selected metric. The forecasting model generates these values using historical trends and helps anticipate upcoming changes in resource usage.

| Label | Description / Example |
| --- | --- |
| Time | Future timestamp for calculating the forecast (e.g., May 01, 2025 01:00 AM). |
| Upper Band | The highest possible predicted value based on trend analysis (e.g., 8.03%). |
| Predicted | The most likely expected value (center of the forecast range) (e.g., 7.64%). |
| Lower Band | The lowest possible predicted value based on trend analysis (e.g., 7.20%). |

**Export**

#### Adaptive Threshold

It helps detect anomalies in performance metrics by automatically learning patterns and setting dynamic thresholds, instead of relying on fixed, static values. It is part of the Prediction engine and is particularly useful for identifying unusual behavior in real-time monitoring data.

Adaptive Thresholds are **model-generated** limits that define what is considered "normal" for each metric over time. Instead of using a fixed value (like 80% for all metrics), the system learns from historical data and sets a **custom threshold for each hour** of each day.

This ensures better accuracy in detecting genuine anomalies while reducing noise, especially in environments with varying traffic patterns, workloads, or seasonal behavior.

##### **How Adaptive Threshold is Created**

**Data Collection**

The system regularly collects performance metrics (polled data) (e.g., every 5 minutes).

**Model Training**

The short-term prediction model is trained using the **last 30 days of historical data**, which is aggregated at an hourly level. This model generates adaptive thresholds for identifying anomalies in real time.

**Window Forecasting**

The model predicts usage for the **next 2 weeks**, broken down **hour by hour**.

**Threshold Generation**

For each hour, the system generates the following dynamic thresholds:

* **Polled Data** – Actual collected data from the resource.
* **Lower Band** – Minimum expected value.
* **Upper Band** – Maximum expected value.
* **Critical Upper Band** – A stricter upper threshold for flagging critical anomalies.

These thresholds help the system determine normal vs. abnormal behavior for each time window.

##### **How It Works**

Adaptive Thresholds use short-term **time-series prediction models** that learn usage patterns over time. Key concepts include:

* **Trend detection –** Identifies regular increase/decrease patterns.
* **Hourly profiling –** Learns a "normal" value for each specific hour.
* **Upper and lower bounds –** Represent a statistical confidence range.
* **Model refresh –** Rebuilt every 7 days using the latest data.

The system avoids overfitting or underfitting by using a balanced model sensitivity.

##### **What do you see on the screen**

The **Adaptive Threshold** screen displays a performance graph that visually compares actual system behavior against dynamically learned threshold ranges. The graph provides a real-time, hour-by-hour overview of how a metric (e.g., CPU, memory, interface utilization) performs relative to predicted safe zones.

**Adaptive Threshold |** Basic Details

| Label | Action | Description / Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Polled Data | Displays actual usage | Blue line showing real-time performance values collected at intervals. |
| Lower Band | Shows the minimum predicted value | Bottom boundary of the threshold range. Values below this are considered anomalies. |
| Upper Band | Shows the maximum predicted value | Top boundary of the expected range. Values above this may indicate a warning or anomaly. |
| Critical Upper Band | Flags high-risk upper threshold | Stricter limit above the Upper Band used to detect critical-level anomalies. |
| Red Markers | Highlights anomalies | Appears when actual data goes outside the threshold bands. |
| Filters | | |
| Current Month | Time filter | Displays data from today to the end of the current month. |
| Next Month | Time filter | Displays projected threshold behavior for the following month. |
| Next 3 Months | Time filter | Shows threshold forecasts and anomalies across the next 90 days. |
| Next 6 Month | Time filter | Displays long-term prediction and anomaly trend for up to 180 days. |

**Adaptive Threshold |** Basic Details

This provides a detailed view of predicted thresholds and anomalies for each timestamp.

| Label | Description / Example |
| --- | --- |
| Time | Timestamp for each data point (e.g., May 18, 2025 12:00 AM). |
| Upper Band | The maximum expected value for the metric at that time (e.g., 8.37%). |
| Lower Band | The minimum expected value for the time slot (e.g., 6.19%). |
| Critical Upper Band | A stricter limit highlights critical anomalies (e.g., 9.47%). |
| Anomaly | Indicates whether the actual value exceeded thresholds (e.g., 20%). |
| Toggle: Show Only Anomalies | Filters the table to display only rows where anomalies are detected. |

**Export**

The adaptive threshold graph can be downloaded as a **PDF**, while the **adaptive threshold Data** table can be exported in **CSV format** for detailed offline review or further processing.

## IMACD (Beta)

IMACD stands for Install, Move, Add, Change, and Dispose, which provides a structured way to manage organizational changes smoothly. It combines system installation, coherent movement, planned inclusions, adaptation, and organized disposal, forming a strong guide for transformation.

It’s a well-organized path for handling any shift, from setting up new systems to retiring outdated resources. This approach ensures smoother transitions, minimizes disruptions, and streamlines changes within the ever-evolving business landscape.

![IMACD Lifecycle, (ITAM, ITSM)](https://docs.infraon.io/infraon-help/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F8249392-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FE4mkwSP8a1BSD9BFNFav%252Fuploads%252FDi4H7A6DFrUQqq35NlxQ%252FIMACD%2520Lifecycle.svg%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D72dcf51d-3015-4b5a-b6a4-13593d16f6c8&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=5a92a0f&sv=2)

From setting up new systems to responsibly recycling old ones, the IMACD process breaks down into five distinct stages, each tackling a core element of IT management and resource handling:

### **Installation**

The Installation phase focuses on deploying and configuring new IT assets within the target infrastructure. This encompasses provisioning compute nodes, client devices, applications, and network fabric. Meticulous installation guarantees the functional integrity and optimal performance of these components.

It is the foundational layer for a highly available and resilient IT ecosystem, where adherence to best practices ensures optimal system operation and efficient resource utilization.

![ITSM IMACD Installation Workflow](https://docs.infraon.io/infraon-help/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F8249392-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FE4mkwSP8a1BSD9BFNFav%252Fuploads%252FPEti0n5FbzZO8w3LHPfJ%252FInstallation%2520workflow.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D0f222ad2-7746-4856-a46f-c72b33565da4&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=4bae242&sv=2)

### **Move**

The IMACD Move phase addresses the physical and logical relocation of IT resources. This encompasses the migration of hardware assets to a new site (e.g., office relocation or reconfiguration) and the transfer of data and software between servers or cloud environments.

![ITSM IMACD Movement Workflow](https://docs.infraon.io/infraon-help/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F8249392-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FE4mkwSP8a1BSD9BFNFav%252Fuploads%252FldKYWBHtlypTjTlGRS0g%252FMovement%2520Workflow.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Dfd6039e7-f619-40df-91ff-58f3295984ac&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=7d7e6d9&sv=2)

### **Add**

The "Add" phase of IMACD focuses on the planned integrations of new IT components into the existing infrastructure. This involves the strategic onboarding and configuration of various elements, including:

* Software applications: Deploy and integrate new software tools with existing systems, ensuring compatibility and data interoperability.
* Hardware upgrades: Incorporation of enhanced hardware components to augment performance, functionality, or capacity, adhering to technical specifications and compatibility standards.
* Network expansions: Extension of the network infrastructure to accommodate additional devices, locations, or increased bandwidth requirements, following network design principles and security best practices.

![ITSM IMACD Addition Workflow](https://docs.infraon.io/infraon-help/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F8249392-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FE4mkwSP8a1BSD9BFNFav%252Fuploads%252FCSs04ewHzL8vvYnJeHFY%252FAddition%2520Workflow.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Da3dff5ee-77c6-441b-a272-528af74dfcf7&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=f4accdb6&sv=2)

### **Change**

The configuration management workflow within IT operations hinges on controlled deployments to modify or update hardware or software configurations. This Change Management phase addresses evolving business needs and issues through controlled modifications. Examples include:

* Network infrastructure modifications: Adjusting routing protocols, firewall rules, or VLAN configurations.
* Software updates: Deploying new versions of operating systems, applications, or firmware.
* Security enhancements: Implementing additional access controls, encryption protocols, or intrusion detection systems.

### Gate pass

It moves important IT equipment or valuable assets across different organizational locations. A gate pass becomes the essential tool for streamlined and secure movement. It is an authorization document granting permission for specific assets to leave and enter designated areas. This ensures transparent and accountable transfer, whether the asset is shipped between offices or fixed assets are handed over within a department.

Gate passes usually have a barcode or a QR code for convenience and security. This allows quick and easy checkpoint scanning, further enhancing control and record-keeping.

It typically includes information like:

* Date and time of issuance: To track authorized movement within a specific timeframe.
* Description of goods: Details about the items being moved, like quantity, type, and serial numbers.
* Recipient and origin: Identifying who receives the goods and where the asset came from.
* Admin’s signature: Authorizing the movement by designated personnel.

#### Instructions to add a Gate Pass

Follow the below steps to construct the gate pass of the respective asset for the IMACD process:

* Clicking on the IMACD process ID.
* Navigate to the ‘Add Template’ section on the right panel of the page in the Gate Pass section.
* Enter the below details:

**Gate Pass| Fields**

| Label | Description/ Example |
| --- | --- |
| Template Name | Enter a custom name for this gate pass template. |
| Transporter Name | Enter the transporter name for the assigned shipment. |
| Transporter | Add the transporter details. |
| Bundle ID | Add the unique identifier assigned to the respective asset. |
| Shipment ID | Add the Shipment ID associated with the assigned process. |
| Due On | Set the date this gate pass will no longer be valid. |
| Issue Date | Add the date when the gate pass will be issued. |
| Phone Number | Enter the phone numbers of the respective assignee. |

* Select the type of scanning required, either barcode or QR code.
* Once all the details are entered correctly, click on the Save option.

**Note:** Click the Add Custom Field to personalize your pass with additional information beyond the standard categories. This can help ensure smoother gate procedures and improve record-keeping.






## Ticket Management

Infraon's ticket Management module enables users/organizations to achieve their goals through the following steps:

* **Ticket Detection and Recording** - This is the first step of ticket management, which involves an end-user identifying an interruption and deciding to record it by submitting a ticket. Tickets can be submitted by

  * logging it directly on the portal
  * sending an email to the service desk mail address
  * calling the service desk helpline number
  * using the Infraon mobile app (future release)
* **Classification & Categorization**—Though tickets can be identified and recorded by anyone (agents/technicians/end users), the service desk agent must classify and categorize them appropriately. Tickets are usually given a category and sub-category.
* **Initial support** - Once identified, based on the simplicity of the issue reported, the service desk technicians can offer initial support to the requester.
* **Investigation & Diagnosis** - Next, the service/help desk agent moves on to troubleshoot the issue reported by investigating it further and coming up with a diagnosis. It is not about finding the root cause and fixing it with tickets. Tickets are about resuming services ASAP, which means finding workarounds, temporary fixes, etc.
* **Escalation & Notification** - When a ticket requires additional or advanced support, support/help desk agents escalate to the next level of support (L2/L3) or field engineers while informing the requester and technicians of the proceedings.
* **Resolution & Recovery**—Resolution is a workaround/temporary fix/software patch that is applied and confirms that the service is recovered/restored.
* **Ticket closure**—Though the service desk technician adds a resolution and marks recovery, a ticket is considered closed only when the requester agrees to the resolution.
* **Auto Closure for tickets**: The system configuration automatically closes the ticket after the specified days. Requests can be applied similarly, making managing and completing large requests easy.

Ticket Workflow

#### State and Status

The status of a ticket is based on the state of the ticket.

| State | Status | Status Scenario |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Open | New | When a ticket is newly reported. |
| In Progress | Analysis | When the ticket is in progress, and the technician is performing an analysis of the ticket detail. |
| In Progress | Escalated | When the ticket is in progress and is being escalated due to missing or incomplete information. |
| On-Hold | Pending | The status can only be ‘Pending’ when the ticket is kept on hold. |
| Resolved | Accepted | When the ticket is resolved, and the Customer accepts the solution. Once the customer marks it as accepted, the ticket will be automatically redirected to Formal closure of the ticket with the State marked as Closed. |
| Resolved | Rejected | When the customer does not accept the solution, it is marked as Rejected, automatically resulting in Reopen of the ticket. |
| Resolved | Resolved by Event | When the ticket is automatically closed by an external event. |
| Resolved | Resolved by Origin ticket | When the ticket is closed by primary/parent ticket |
| Resolved | Waiting for Closure | Information is to be updated when the ticket is resolved and is waiting for closure. |

> Customized Status(es) can be configured from the 'Workflow' module to suit the requirement.

### Tickets

A Ticket can be defined as an unplanned interruption to an IT service, reduction in the quality of an IT service, or failure of an asset/Item that has not yet impacted service. Ticket Management is the process responsible for managing the life cycle of tickets. The goal of ticket Management is to restore standard service as quickly as possible with minimal to no disruption to the business. This ensures that the highest achievable levels of availability and service are maintained.

#### How does it work?

Tickets can be created by end-users/requesters through the web portal or mobile app access, via email, or by a technician on call. When tickets are created from email, the message's subject line becomes the ticket summary, the message body becomes the description, and the source field is set to Email.

The quick action panel helps technicians resolve tickets quickly, reducing ticket resolution time by 80%.

#### What you see on the screen

The tickets page lists all tickets with details like summary card, impact service, status, subject, team, requester name, and actions, sorted by time. Refer to the 'Working on a Ticket' section for detailed information.

##### **Working on a ticket**

The service desk is the core of Ticket Management. Though there are multiple ways to record a ticket, Ticket work or resolution is in the hands of Technicians.

Before working on the Ticket, it is necessary to understand its life cycle and the key components within Infraon's Ticket module.

###### Components

* **Ticket Summary Card** - The ticket summary card briefly summarizes the ticket. This summary contains all the important information needed to work on the ticket. Details include:
* **Ticket ID** – Auto-generated when a ticket is created. Click on the ticket ID to view the communication history, reply to and forward emails, add notes, analyze, add symptoms and root causes, and view and add work logs. You can resolve a ticket from this screen too.
* **Ticket Source** – This shows how the ticket was submitted.
* **Priority** – The priority of the ticket (derived from the asset)
* **Asset ID** - Asset for which the ticket is raised. Click on the asset ID to view detailed asset information.
* **Comment** – The requester or technician’s comment on the ticket
* **Analyze** – Used to view details of the ticket
* **Requester Icon** – Displays the name of the requester (initial)
* **Subject** – Subject of the ticket (derived from the ticket subject line)

###### Communication

The Communication tab acts as your central hub for all ticket interactions. Clicking on it opens a dedicated window displaying the complete communication history, including emails, SMS messages, and any comments added throughout the ticket lifecycle.

This streamlines resolution by allowing technicians to access all relevant information quickly, keeping everyone informed—assignee, team, and requester.

The tab also empowers technicians to send emails and SMS messages directly to the end-user without leaving the window.

For added convenience, Infraon Infinity features a dynamic section with a requester dropdown, eliminating the need for manual entry. Furthermore, technicians and end-users can attach files and add signatures for enhanced clarity and authenticity.

**Text enhancement** - Effortlessly refine your communication in tickets. Receive real-time prompts for improved text, with options for tone and style adjustments. Elevate your message with professional, conversational, emphatic, or simple tones. Explore the proofreading, rephrasing, and content expansion tools all in one seamless interface!

## Request Management

A Service Request is a formal request raised by a user for information, support, access to IT, or something new to be provided. In Infraon, service requests are called "Request." Request Management is the process responsible for managing the life cycle of requests. Request Management aims to support the agreed quality of service by handling all pre-defined, user-initiated requests in an effective and user-friendly manner.

Infraon's Request Management module enables users/organizations to achieve their goals through the following steps:

* **Request Recording** - This is the first step of request management. A user identifies the need for a service and formally requests it through the request management portal. Requests can be raised through the following channels:

  * logging a request through the portal
  * sending an email to the service desk mail address
  * calling the service desk helpline number
* **Classification & Organization**- Though requests can be identified and recorded by anyone (agents/technicians/end users), it is the responsibility of the service desk agent to classify and organize them appropriately. Requests have a type and classification.
* **Initial support**- Once identified, based on the simplicity of the service requested, the service desk technicians can offer initial support to the requester.
* **Escalation** - If an agent feels that the request is more of a ticket and impacts a service, he can convert it into a ticket and assign it to the appropriate team.
* **Resolution**- Resolution provides the information requested by the requester, new hardware provided to the requester, and so on.
* **Closure**- The service desk technician adds a note and marks the request as Resolved. A request is considered closed only when the requester agrees on the resolution given.

### **Request Transfer state**

In addition to these, Infraon also covers request ownership, monitoring, tracking, and communication throughout each request's life cycle.

Requests are managed through the "Request" module. They can be raised by service desk agents or end-users, referred to as requesters. Requests follow multiple state(s) and status(es) throughout their life cycle.

**Request Logging**: State Open, Status New

**Request Categorization:**Status Assign- Categorize Request Type, Service Classification, Priority, Followers, Tags

**Request Diagnosis:** State In progress, Status Analysis

**Escalation Functional:**State In progress, Status Escalated

**Resolution:** State Resolved, Status  Waiting for closure (Provide Resolution)

**Closure:** State Closed, Status Completed(Update closure Category, Closure Note

* When a request title is added, Infraon displays related Knowledge Base articles. If a related resolution is available, the technician can add it to the request resolution and close the request directly.

Once all details are added, the user must click "Submit as New" - to submit the request.






## Problem Management

A problem is an underlying root cause of one or more tickets. Recurring incidents with common issues lead to a problem. \*A problem can be linked to tickets(reported for the same underlying issue), a request, or a change(part of a future release). Problem Management is the process responsible for managing the lifecycle of the problem from its creation till its closure. Problem management aims to provide solutions or workarounds to problems so they have a minimum impact on the organization. Problem Management also seeks to prevent a problem from reoccurring.

### How does it work?

Only a technician or users with the required permissions can log a Problem. While adding a problem in the Problem module, a technician records the source of the problem. The source can be one of the following:

* Web portal
* Mobile app
* Email
* By a technician on call

Streamlined problem-to-ticket association. Create a problem, log a ticket from the problem view page, add internal notes, and submit to establish the relationship. Click on the ticket ID, and the ticket will open on a new page for seamless navigation and management.

### Benefits of Problem Management

Efficient Problem Management can have several benefits for an organization. It can also add substantial value to a business. Some of the benefits of Problem Management are:

* Increase in Service Availability
* Increase in Productivity
* Customer Satisfaction
* Decrease in the number of tickets
* Cost Saving

### Problem Management Process

Infraon's Problem Management module enables organizations to achieve their goals through the following steps:

* **Problem Detection** - This is the first step of Problem Management. A problem can be detected in two ways.

  * Suppose different requesters raise multiple tickets for the same issue. This means there is an underlying issue that needs to be further analyzed, and a problem is recorded.
  * If a completely new issue arises with an unknown underlying cause, then a problem is recorded.
* **Problem Recording**  - Only a technician or users with the required permissions can log a Problem in the module.
* **Classification & Prioritization**  - It is essential to capture all the problem details, such as problem type and description. A problem has a category and sub-category. Capturing and classifying the details makes it easier to assign & monitor the problem.
* **Investigation & Diagnosis** - Problem management is finding the root cause of an issue. A detailed Root Cause Analysis(RCA) is performed based on the urgency and severity of the problem. Multiple analyses can be added until the root cause is identified. The various methods used for analysis are:

  * 5-Whys
  * Chronological
  * Kepner Tregoe
* **Create a Known Error Record** - In ITIL, a Known Error is "a problem with a documented root cause and a workaround." It is essential to record this information in a known error database (KEDB) so that if this issue or problem arises, the service desk technician can quickly look into the KEDB and provide a quick resolution or associated workaround. This leads to less downtime.
* **Create a workaround, if necessary** - A workaround is a temporary solution to a problem so that it can reduce the impact on a business. A workaround for a problem can be created and documented in the KEDB.
* **Escalation & Notification**—When a problem requires more significant expertise, a technician escalates it to L2/L3-level technicians or engineers. Notification emails keep the technicians well-informed of these proceedings.
* **Resolution**  - A resolution is a permanent fix for a problem such that it can no longer cause another ticket.
* **Review & Closure -** The resolution is reviewed to ensure its effectiveness. Once the technicians are satisfied with it, the problem can be closed.

Problem Workflow

#### **Problem Management and relation with other processes**

| Process | Relation with Problem Management |
| --- | --- |
| Ticket Management | Different requesters raising multiple tickets for the same issue denotes an underlying issue that needs to be further analyzed.A new issue is raised with an unknown underlying causeIn the above cases, a problem is logged. These tickets can be linked to the problem. The tickets are put on hold until a workaround/solution is provided. |
| \*Request Management | A service request raised by a user to install new software in the laptop may have disrupted/corrupted other software.Implementing a resolution to a problem may require a user to raise a service request to install a software patch.In the above cases, the service requests can be linked to the problem. |
| \*Change Management | Sometimes, a change may disrupt service. This leads to logging a ticket and, subsequently, a problem in analyzing the cause.Problem Management may initiate resolution through a change request. The approval/implementation of the change is beyond the scope of Problem Management. This needs to be done in Change Management.In this case, a change request is linked to the problem. |
| \*Knowledge Management | Important information regarding workarounds, resolutions and Known Errors (KE) is often the output of Problem Management.Similarly, information and documents available in Knowledge Base(KB) can serve as a beginning point to diagnose and investigate a problem.In these cases, Knowledge Management comes into the picture. KBs can be attached to the problem, or a resolution or Known Error information can be turned into a Knowledge Base article. |

> \*These linking options will be part of the future release.

Infraon also covers problem ownership, monitoring, tracking, and communication throughout each problem's life cycle.

Problems are managed through the "Problem" module. Technicians or users with the required permissions, referred to as requesters, can raise problems. Problems follow multiple state(s) and status(es) throughout their life cycle.

##### State and Status

| State | Status | Status Scenario |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Open | New | When a new problem is logged in the system. The status of the associated tickets is put "On-Hold." |
| Open | Waiting for Assignee | When a problem is newly created, it is next waiting to be assigned to a technician. |
| In Progress | Investigation | When the Root-Cause Analysis of the problem is in progress. |
| In Progress | Diagnosis | When the problem analysis is in progress and misses the "Due By" date. Then it is escalated to the next technician. |
| On-Hold | Waiting for Customer | The status can only be ‘Pending’ when the problem is kept on hold either for Customer input. |
| On-Hold | Pending Changes | If any changes are pending to be implemented. |
| Resolved | Resolution Applied | When a resolution(permanent fix) is applied to the problem. The users are notified. |
| Resolved | Solved | When the users are satisfied with the resolution provided by the technicians. |

> Customized Status(es) can be configured from the 'Workflow' module to suit the requirement.

Easily convert resolved Problems to Knowledge Base articles. KB icon appears post-resolution, ensuring efficient knowledge management.

### Problem

A problem is the underlying root cause of one or more tickets. Recurring tickets with common issues lead to problems. In other words, a problem must be logged for anything that requires a root cause analysis. The outcome of a problem can be a solution, a change, or a service request.

Problem Management is the process responsible for managing a problem's lifecycle from its creation to its closure. It aims to provide solutions or workarounds to problems so that they have minimal impact on the organization and prevent them from reoccurring.

#### How does it work?

Only a technician or users with the required permissions can log a Problem. While adding a problem in the Problem module, a technician records the source of the problem. The source can be one of the following:

* Web portal
* Mobile app
* Email
* By a technician on call
* WhatsApp
* Chatbot

#### What do you see on the screen?

The "Problem" page lists all problems in two views: Panel View and Grid View. It includes a summary card, problem description, status, subject, team, requester name, and actions sorted by time.

#### Working on a Problem

Problem Management requires a high level of expertise. While there are multiple ways to record a problem, the resolution of the problem is in the hands of L2/L3-level technicians.

Before working on the problem, it is necessary to understand the life cycle of problems and the key components within Infraon's Problem module.

###### Problem Views

There are two ways to view problem details in the right-side panel. They are:

**Panel View** - In the Panel view, you see problem details as a Summary Card. The summary card gives a summary of the problem. This summary contains all the important information needed to work on the problem. Details include:

* Problem ID: Auto-generated when a problem is created.
* Requester: Name of the requester
* Team: The team assigned to work on the problem.
* Status: Displays the current status of the problem. Technicians can change the status from here as well.
* Priority: Displays the priority of the problem. Technicians can change the priority of the problem.
* Service: The area in which the problem is reported.
* Resolve: The technicians can resolve the problem using this panel.
* Actions: Quick action icons to work on the problem.

The panel view for tickets has been revamped. The improved interface offers enhanced data visibility, with aging metrics conveniently displayed. This helps in faster navigation and reduced system load for a seamless user experience.

**Grid View** - You see problem details in tabular form in Grid View. Clicking on the Problem ID shows the details of the Problem.

**Problem ID:** Auto-generated when a problem is created. Click on the Problem ID to view the communication history, reply to and forward emails, add notes, analyze, view, and add work logs. You can resolve a problem from this screen too.

* **Problem Source:** This shows how the problem was submitted.
* **Priority:** The priority of the problem
* **Requester:** Displays the name of the requester (initial)
* **Subject:** Subject of the problem (derived from the problem subject line)
* **Team:** The team to which the problem is assigned
* **Assignee:** The person to whom the problem is assigned
* **Actions:** Quick action icons to work on the problem

**Note:**

* The quick action bar appears as a floater on each problem line and is common in both Panel and Grid views.
* The summary card details can be configured to suit requirements. Click on the "Configure" icon to customize the details you want to see on the screen.
* The Configure icon is available only in Grid View.

##### Analysis

Problem Management is about finding the root cause of an issue. A detailed Root Cause Analysis(RCA) is performed based on the urgency and severity of the problem. When we click on the Problem ID, the problem details are opened. In the right-side panel, there is an option to add the analysis of the problem. Multiple analyses can be added until the root cause is identified. These analysis details are saved as a Draft and can be viewed/edited anytime. The various methods used for analysis are:

###### 5 Whys Method

Sakichi Toyoda, the founder of Toyota Industries, originally developed the 5 whys method. This iterative analysis technique aims to expose the underlying cause by asking "Why" five times. The number"5" comes from the observation that five iterations of the question "why" usually reveal the underlying root cause.

How to implement the 5 whys method:

* Ask why the problem took place. Write the answer to this question.
* Keep asking 'why' to the successive answers and note down the answers.
* Repeat the step above until you reach the root cause of the problem.

This may take five or fewer 'whys'. If you are satisfied with the analysis, click on 'Save Changes' to save it.

###### Chronological Method

As the name suggests, Chronological analysis is a time-based approach. It helps look at events in order of occurrence from first to last. All the events from the time a problem occurred are recorded and analyzed in chronological order.

###### Kepner Tregoe Method

Kepner Tregoe method is a problem-analysis method developed by Charles Kepner and Benjamin Tregoe. It is a step-by-step approach to systematically gathering information and evaluating it. It gathers the following information in a structured way.

* What is the problem? Begin by defining the problem.
* Where does the problem occur? Note down the LOCATION of the problem.
* When did the problem occur? Note down the TIME of the problem occurrence.
* How frequently has the problem occurred?
* What is the size of the problem? How many parts are affected?

##### Solution/Workaround

###### Workaround

Sometimes it is possible to temporarily fix the problem so the user can continue the business as usual. This can be documented in the Solution/Workaround section. Once a workaround is provided, the associated tickets can be closed. The problem's status will remain open until a permanent solution is found.

###### Solution

A Solution is a permanent fix to the problem. This can be documented in the Solution/Workaround section, and an entry is made into the Known Error Database(KEDB), and the problem is marked as Closed.

##### **Miscellaneous**

###### **Additional Icons**

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |

## Change Management

ITIL defines Change as "the addition, modification, or removal of any authorized, planned, or supported service or service component that could affect services." In other words, a Change is adding, removing, or modifying anything that could directly or indirectly affect the organization's services and operations. The changes could include documentation, processes, applications, or IT infrastructure. In Infraon, the module that handles all the change requests is called "Change."

Change Management is a set of processes defined to manage the lifecycle of a change request. It aims to minimize risks and disruptions to IT services and business operations while implementing changes.

### Benefits of Change Management

* Reduced system downtime and outage
* Faster change implementation
* Decreased negative impact on business and IT services
* Visibility into future IT changes

### Essential Roles in Change Management

**Change Manager** - A Change Manager is responsible for reviewing the submitted change requests, scheduling Change Advisory Board(CAB) meetings, updating the change records, reviewing the rollback and rollout plans, coordinating the implementation of changes, and reviewing the implemented changes. Usually, a high-level manager or a Domain Expert is assigned as a Change Manager to a change request.

**Change Advisory Board(CAB)** - A Change Advisory Board (CAB) may consist of Business, IT Operations, Development, Customer, Domain Experts, and Solution Architects, depending upon the type of the change. A CAB is carefully selected to ensure all facets of an organization are represented while discussing the impacts, benefits, and implementation of a change. CAB requires financial data, the technical advantage of the change request, the number of resources required, criticality, and so on, to make an informed decision on the change request. Depending upon the severity of the change, the Change Manager may decide whom to include in the discussions. A CAB chooses whether to approve or reject a change.

### Change Management Process

Infraon's Change Management module enables users/organizations to implement changes through the following steps seamlessly:

* **Change Detection** is the first step of Change Management. For example, a customer may request a change in the services or ask for additional services. This is logged as a change request. A change request may also arise from a ticket, request, or problem.
* **Change Recording** - A technician or user with the required permissions can log a change in the module.
* **Planning**—In this stage, the change request is planned. A comprehensive plan is essential for the successful implementation of a change. A detailed plan showcases the risks, impacts, rollout plan, rollback plan, and associated downtime(if any) to all stakeholders. Planning is important in getting approvals from the Change Advisory Board (CAB).
* **Analysis** - A detailed analysis is performed to understand a change's risks and impacts on the organization or service(s).
* **Change Approvals -** The change plan needs to be reviewed, and the Change Advisory Board (CAB) decides. The change plan may be approved or rejected.
* **Change Implementation** - Once approved, the change manager ensures the change is implemented as detailed in the plan and at the right time. A Change Manager also ensures coordination between different teams involved in the change implementation.
* **Review** - Once a change is implemented, a post-implementation review is conducted to confirm whether the change was successful. A review is also performed to determine if the change achieved its objectives. If the change implementation is unsuccessful, the rollback plan is activated promptly.
* **Closure** - This is the last step in the Change management process. After conducting a post-implementation review, the change can be closed with closing comments on whether the change was successful, executed on time, and so on.

Change Management

> Apart from these, Infraon also covers change ownership, monitoring, tracking, and communication - throughout the life cycle of each change request.

Changes are managed through the "Change" module. Users with appropriate permissions can raise changes. Changes follow multiple state(s) and status(es) throughout their life cycle.

#### State and Status

| State | Status | Status Scenario |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Open | New | When a new change is logged in the system. |
| In Progress | Planning | When the planning of the change request is in progress. |
| In Progress | Analysis | When the possible risk analysis is in progress. |
| In Progress | Implementation | When the proposed change plans are being implemented. |
| In Progress | Deployment | When the change is being deployed in production. |
| In Progress | Verification | When the deployed change is being verified. |
| On Hold | Pending | If any changes are pending to be implemented. |
| Close | Closed | After Post Implementation Review, the change can be closed with closing comments. |
| Close | Cancel | If the change implementation is canceled. |

Customized Status(es) can be configured from the 'Workflow' module to suit the requirement.

Easily convert resolved Changes to Knowledge Base articles. KB icon appears post-resolution, ensuring efficient knowledge management.

### Change

ITIL defines Change as "the addition, modification, or removal of any authorized, planned, or supported service or service component that could affect IT services." In other words, a Change is adding, removing, or modifying anything that could directly or indirectly affect the organization's services and operations. The changes could include documentation, processes, applications, or IT infrastructure changes.

Change Management is a set of processes defined to manage the lifecycle of a change request from start to closure. It aims to minimize risks and disruptions to IT services and business operations while the changes are being implemented.

#### How does it work?

Domain experts, management, architects, or solution architects are involved in planning and implementing a change request.

##### Types of Change

| Type | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Standard Change | Standard Changes are the ones that frequently occur in an organization. These changes are low-risk and have a pre-defined set of documented and approved processes to be followed. This pre-defined and approved process is called a template. | Reset the Password of an email account. |
| Minor Change | A minor change is a small change that is low-impact and low-risk. These changes only occur occasionally in an organization. A minor change needs approval from the Change Advisory Board(CAB). It is essential to document all the important information for future reference. A minor change could be converted to a standard change in the future. | Changes to the company website. |
| Major Change | A major change is a high-risk and high-impact change. A major change could impact an organization's services if it is not planned properly. It requires an in-depth proposal on risk analysis, financial implications, and cost-benefit analysis. It requires approval from the Change Advisory Board(CAB) as well as from the management. | Changes to Network Infrastructure |
| \*Emergency Change | Emergency changes are unexpected disruptions that must be assessed and implemented as soon as possible to restore the normal functioning of an organization. | Dealing with a server outage |

> \*Emergency Change is not part of this release. It will be implemented in a future release.

#### What do you see on the screen?

The "Change" page lists all change requests in two views: Panel View and Grid View. It lists all changes with details like a summary card, change description, status, subject, team, requester name, and actions, sorted by time.

##### Working on a Change

Change Management involves people from different dimensions of a business. They work together to analyze, plan, and implement the change request.

###### Views of the Change Request

There are two ways to view change details in the right-side panel. They are:

**Panel View** - You see change details as a Summary Card in the Panel view. The summary card gives a brief summary of the change. This summary contains all the important information needed to work on the change. Details include:

* Change ID: Auto-generated when a change is created.
* Requester: Name of the requester
* Change Manager: Name of the manager overlooking the change request.
* Status: Displays the current status of the change. Users can change the status from here as well.
* Priority: Displays the priority of the change. Technicians can change the priority of the change.
* Service: Service category in which change is requested.
* Actions: Quick action icons to work on the change.

The panel view for tickets has been revamped. The improved interface offers enhanced data visibility, with aging metrics conveniently displayed. This helps in faster navigation and reduced system load for a seamless user experience.

**Grid View**- In the Grid view, you see change details in tabular form. Clicking on the Change ID shows the change details.

* Change ID: This is auto-generated when a change is created. Click on the Change ID to view the communication history, reply to and forward emails, add notes, analyze, view, and add work logs.
* Subject: Subject of the change (derived from the change subject line).
* Reason for Change: The reason for detailing why the change was requested.
* Change Type: Type of change: Standard, Major, Minor, and Emergency.
* Status: Displays the current status of the change. Users can change the status from here as well.
* Impact Service: Service Category which the change could impact.
* Priority: The priority of the change.
* Risk: Risk level of the change.
* Requester: Displays the name of the requester (initial)
* Change Manager: Name of the manager overlooking the change request.
* Change Implementer: Name of the user responsible for change implementation.
* Actions: Quick action icons to work on the change.

**Note:**

* The quick action bar appears as a floater on each change line and is common in both Panel and Grid views.
* The summary card details can be configured to suit requirements. Click on the "Configure" icon to customize the details you want to see on the screen.
* The Configure icon is available only in Grid View.

#### Planning and Risk Analysis

Implementing a change requires intensive planning, risk analysis, defining tasks, and approvals. To help users achieve this, the "Change" module has the following tabs:

* **Planning** - A comprehensive plan is essential for successfully implementing a change. In the planning tab, a user can enter the following details:

  * Rollout Plan - A rollout plan is a detailed step-by-step description of how the change will be implemented in the production environment. The rollout plan is created in such a way that there is minimal impact on the organization. A rollout plan describes whether the change will be implemented in a phased manner or as a whole.
  * Rollback Plan - A rollback plan is a verified step-by-step fallback or back-out plan in case the change implementation doesn't go as expected. It is essential to have a rollback plan when implementing a major change.
  * Impact - A user can enter the anticipated impact of the change on various dimensions of the organization. It can be categorized into the following:

    * Business
    * Location
    * Department
    * Group
    * User
  * Planned Start Date - The intended date to begin implementing the change.
  * Planned End Date - The intended date to end implementing the change.
* **Tasks** - In this tab, a user can enter the details of the tasks involved in the change.

## Event Management

Any change observed and detected within your organization is an event.

The primary objective of the event management module within ITIL is to detect all changes or activities within the infrastructure, observe for anomalies and raise the alarm, if necessary. Events are Infraon's way of active and passive monitoring of

* CI items like laptops, desktops, etc.,
* Software licensing and performance
* Application performance
* Server performance

Monitoring the status and availability of items is part of active monitoring, while detection and correlation of operational alerts based on the configured thresholds and triggers are part of passive monitoring.

Infraon's Event Management module enables users/organizations to achieve their goals through the below steps:

* There are constant changes in the infrastructure. Ideally, a user's login, upgrade of software/hardware, or regular maintenance are all events. However, these are not events that need to be notified or taken action upon. When there is a change in the server's performance or availability, it needs to be reported immediately. Infraon extracts the necessary data from the happenings of the infrastructure and detects 'events that need attention on occurrence.
* These anomalies or changes are run through the default thresholds and categorized as basic, informational, major, or performance. Thresholds can be sorted as minor, major, or critical. Refer to the Thresholds section for details.
* Anomalies and changes are categorized and reported as events.
* Technicians or NOC users can use these events to perform necessary actions.

**Note:** If triggers are configured for events, a notification is triggered either at the event's occurrence or after correlating.

Refer to the [Events](/infraon-help/infinity-user-guide/event-management/events) section for more details.






### Events

Infraon detects all changes or activities of CIs or configuration items, observes anomalies based on the configured thresholds, and records them as events. If triggers are configured for the same, notifications or incidents are raised accordingly.

#### How does it work?

Infraon is configured with built-in thresholds for all the monitoring nodes and their components. Infraon monitors the assets constantly. It detects threshold breaches and records them as events. If any thresholds, devices, or metrics are linked in a trigger, Infraon either triggers a notification or converts the event to an Incident.

#### What you see on the screen

The events page lists all events - Issue, Date, Node, Resource, and Event ID, sorted by time. Events have default filters like:

* Critical, Major, and Minor - based on the threshold
* Acknowledged and Ticketed - based on the action
* Priority - based on the asset property
* Root - based on the correlation
* NCCM – This shows events focused exclusively on the NCCM module, including download jobs and configuration changes. By applying this filter, technicians can focus on network configuration and change management activities, making monitoring and addressing NCCM-related issues easier.

Each event allows the below actions (Quick action tool):

Events can be filtered by dates or downloaded using the respective icons.

| Label | Action | Description/ Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Analyse | Click to view the ‘Impact Services’ event details.Click on the ‘More Details’ button to be redirected to the event page. | Includes details to help analyse the event. User can view the asset details and the statistics of what the current event is performing. |
| Acknowledge | | Used to acknowledge the event. NOC users or technicians can acknowledge and add a comment to let other users know they are working on it. |
| Diagnosis | | Used to perform active diagnosis.  Diagnosis can be performed using Ping, SNMP Walk, and Trace Route. |
| Ticket | | Used to create an incident for the event. |
| Clear | | Used to clear the event. Cleared events can be viewed using the 'Show History' toggle button. |
| Activity Log | | Used to view the event history. |






### AIOps Events

#### **What Do You See on the Screen**

You’ll find a range of search and filter options in the Events tab at the top of the screen. These filters help you narrow down events based on their origin.

To focus specifically on events triggered by **AIOps configurations**, use the following filters:

| Label | Description / Example |
| --- | --- |
| Anomaly Event | Displays events generated from prediction-based anomaly detection using adaptive thresholds. |
| Event Suppression | Displays events that are tagged for suppression based on time-based or seasonal logic. These events are still raised, but can be excluded from ticketing if suppression is configured in triggers. |
| Event Association | Shows events grouped by correlation rules learned through event association mining. |

#### Anomaly Events

It identifies and raises alerts when anomalies are detected in monitored resources. It is tightly integrated with the **prediction model** and relies on **adaptive thresholds** generated using machine learning.

* Detects deviation from expected behavior using AI-generated thresholds.
* Converts anomalies into **event alerts**, which can generate tickets **if a trigger is configured**.
* Enables real-time issue identification without relying on static threshold configurations.

##### **How Anomalies Are Detected**

Anomalies are detected by comparing **live polled values** with **model-generated thresholds** derived from the past 30 days of data. The process follows this logic:

1. **Model Learning**The prediction model uses 30 days of historical data to understand the typical behavior of a metric (e.g., CPU, bandwidth usage). It computes:

   * Upper threshold (e.g., expected high usage)
   * Lower threshold (e.g., expected low usage)
   * Mid value (expected average)
2. **Threshold Comparison**The model outputs these threshold bands for every hour in the prediction window (typically the next three weeks). The system continuously compares incoming poll data with these thresholds.
3. **Anomaly Trigger**

* If the **actual value** exceeds the **upper threshold** or drops below the **lower threshold**, it is flagged as an anomaly.
* An **event is raised**, and based on the configuration, a **ticket is auto-generated**.

**Example:**
A bank branch typically consumes 3–6 Mbps on weekdays. Suddenly, 2 Gbps of data is transferred on a Sunday. The system recognizes this spike as an anomaly and flags it.

#### Seasonal Event

It is a mechanism designed to reduce alert fatigue by suppressing known, expected, or repetitive events within specific time windows. These events are often harmless and predictable and do not require user action. It is used to:

* To **prevent unnecessary noise** in the event system.
* Avoid triggering **notifications** such as **tickets, emails, SMS, or JSON alerts** for known recurring behavior (e.g., nightly shutdowns in retail or banking environments).
* Improves **event signal-to-noise ratio**, making real issues more visible.

##### **How Suppression is Detected**

* Suppression is **time-based** and can be **manually configured**.
* Suppressed events are **not discarded** — they are **logged** but do **not generate notifications or tickets**.
* Common use case: devices shut down every evening at 8 PM. The system learns or is told not to raise events during this window.

##### **Configuration**

Navigate to the **Advanced Resource Configuration (ARC)** module and enable the **Seasonal Event Suppression** toggle under prediction settings. You may need to adjust business hour profiles and ensure the correct metrics are selected.

A valid license is required to activate this feature.

* In the **Events module**, suppressed events are still visible but marked (e.g., “Suppressed” tag).
* They will **not trigger tickets** or **alert notifications** unless manually configured otherwise.
* Suppressed event counts can be viewed in the **dashboard widgets** and **reports**.

#### Event Association

Event Association is correlating multiple related events across components or systems and identifying them as part of a **common cause or impact zone**. It is used to:

* To **detect root causes** when multiple alerts are triggered together.
* To **group events** meaningfully rather than treating them as isolated issues.
* Helps in large, distributed environments where **dependent systems** impact each other (e.g., a UPS failure causing router, switch, and IP camera outages).
* The learned associations can also be **used to dynamically build a logical topology**, allowing users to visualize event flows and dependencies, even when no static topology is configured.

##### **How Associations Are Detected**

Infraon AIOps analyzes the last 90 days of event history to identify patterns and recurring relationships between events. It learns which events frequently occur together and detects potential correlations across components.

The system generates association rules based on two key parameters:

* Confidence (%) – Indicates the likelihood that one event is related to another.
* Support Value – Represents how often a pattern has occurred in the observed data.

##### **Configuration**

To configure Event Association, navigate to the Advanced Resource Configuration (ARC) module and follow the steps below:

* Enable the Event Association Mining toggle under the selected asset.
* Provide the following configuration inputs:

  * **Statistic**: Select the specific metric (e.g., CPU utilization, bandwidth) on which event association should be applied.
  * **Confidence (%):** Defines the strength of the relationship between two events. For example, a value of 90% means there's a high likelihood that one event is related to another.
  * **Support Value:** Specifies how often the same event pattern must occur before it is considered significant. For example, a value of 5 means the system must observe the pattern at least five times.
* Once configured, Infraon uses this data to detect recurring relationships and generate association rules that link related events across your environment.

These associations will be reflected in the Events module with the label “Associated”, showing grouped events and potential root causes.

* In the UI, a **parent-child event relationship** is displayed.
* The association details (what triggered what, how confident the system is, etc.) can be traced in the event’s detail view.
* You can also view these associations in relevant dashboards, where grouped event patterns are visually represented.






## Report

Data without perspective can be useless. To maximize the use of data, Infraon provides attractive and easily customizable reports that ensure data monitoring is appropriate for everyone within the organization.

Infraon reports provide a detailed analysis of the performance and fault-related data collected. Reports include:

* Trending, pattern, and summary analysis to analyze past behavior.
* Perform trend analysis and pattern analysis with historical data to help predict future behavior.

Infraon's default reports are highly configurable and flexible. Collecting, summarizing, and pruning historical data makes long-term data easily manageable. The combination of real-time and historical reporting aids in identifying trends, predicting system behaviour, and making well-informed management decisions to drive future expansions.

Infraon's timescale and data fields in the report filter the asset details at a granular level using the columns, timescale orders, and order by. Improvising asset report functionality, providing enhanced data analysis and filtering capabilities.

Infraon supports exporting reports and pre-configured auto-reports in PDF/Excel/CSV formats. Advanced real-time and historical reporting capabilities can be customized according to user preferences to help them view essential data.






### How does it work

Multiple pre-configured reports are available on Infraon. These can be customized, and new custom reports can also be added.

The AIOps Reports module offers multiple reports tailored for proactive monitoring, capacity planning, and anomaly detection. Users can select the appropriate category and apply relevant filters to generate the desired report output.

**Report Category**

| Category | Action | Description / Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Forecast Report | Click to apply filters and view. | Leverages AI/ML models to forecast resource utilization. Data is grouped into buckets based on usage trends to help anticipate future performance issues. |
| Forecast Summary Report | Click to apply filters and view. | Summarizes forecasted resource behavior into defined buckets using AI/ML. Ideal for identifying underutilized or overutilized assets for capacity planning. |
| Forecast Trend Report | Click to apply filters and view. | Analyzes historical time-series data and projects future trends. Displays minimum, maximum, and average forecast values to support long-term planning. |
| Prediction Report | Click to apply filters and view. | Plots current performance statistics over time and overlays predicted values for upcoming intervals. Helps detect anomalies based on expected behavior. |
| | | |

#### Adhoc Reports

These lightweight, on-demand reports allow users to view specific forecast or prediction outputs quickly without going through a whole report generation workflow. These reports are intended for immediate needs, offering a fast way to check trends or anomalies for resources or components.

They are instrumental when:

* Users want to quickly verify a specific state or metric (e.g., view CPU usage forecast for a single router).
* There is no need to build or save a formal report.
* Users want to avoid filters, selections, or extensive configuration and see direct output (statistical, prediction, or pattern).

These reports do not persist in the system unless downloaded and are meant to be accessed, viewed, and closed with minimal effort.

##### **Add Adhoc Report**

* Navigate to the Reports module from the left-side panel of the application.
* Click on the Adhoc Reports option at the top-right corner of the page.
* You will be prompted to choose between two report types:

**Adhoc Reports |** Basic Details

| Label | Action | Description / Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Forecast Report | Click to view | · Displays long-term trends for the selected metric or component.· Based on a 180-day forecasting model.- Shows projected behavior over future time intervals.· Helpful in anticipating capacity needs or gradual usage spikes. |
| Prediction Report | Click to view | · Focuses on short-term anomaly detection.· Uses adaptive thresholds generated from recent metric history.· Identifies unusual patterns such as traffic spikes during off-peak hours.· Ideal for real-time anomaly validation. |

###### **Initiate a Report**

To initiate an Adhoc report, begin by selecting the desired report type—either Forecast or Prediction. Once selected, proceed by filling in the necessary input details. These act as filters and determine what data will be shown for the chosen module.

**Adhoc Reports |** Input Parameters

| Label | Action | Description / Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Asset | Select an asset from the drop-down. | Displays only assets that were configured under Advanced Resource Configuration. |
| Resource | Select the appropriate resource. | Choose the specific component (e.g., port, CPU) for which you want to view prediction or forecast data. |
| Statistics | Select a metric from the drop-down. | Choose the relevant performance metric to analyze (e.g., CPU Utilization, Memory Utilization, Bandwidth Usage). |

After configuring the required fields, click **View Report** to generate the on-demand report. The generated report can also be **downloaded** for offline analysis or sharing.

The available data mirrors what is already present under the Statistics section in the Asset module. Users can quickly select specific assets and metrics without navigating the hierarchy.






## Knowledge Base

A Knowledge Base (KB) is a repository of information about products, services, related topics, etc., intended for self-service. KB makes it easy for users to search for solutions instead of contacting the help desk or experts for repeated/common problems. It is recommended to include articles/guides about all products and services within the organization to enable contactless, round-the-clock self-service.

Infraon's Knowledge Base module enables users to author their articles, curate articles/guides from internal or external sources, and use, share, and manage knowledge across organizations and end-users.

### Why Knowledge Base?

Studies conducted by Forrester and Ciboodle state that:

* **70%** of customers prefer to use a company's website to get answers to their questions rather than use phone or email.
* An efficient knowledge base can enable customers to manage 85% of their relationship with an enterprise without interacting with humans, allowing organizations to save.
* Organizations saw a **50%** increase in Customer Satisfaction ratings through social Customer Support (Public Knowledge Base).

An adequate Knowledge Base empowers the end user to quickly find the necessary answers and information without having to go through the hassle of waiting to get hold of an agent on call or waiting for their incident to get assigned to a Techie.

Having said that, to get all the advantages of a Knowledge Base, it is essential to present such complicated and detailed information in a user-friendly format, which Infraon's Knowledge Base offers. Infraon's KB is designed to add quick problem-solving tips, troubleshooting guides, answers to frequently asked questions, sharing best practices through Articles, known errors, and so on in a user-friendly manner.

### How to build an effective Knowledge Base?

A study by Coleman Parkes for Amdocs states that **91%**of customers would be glad to use the available online database only if it is tailored to their needs. As easy as it may seem to build a knowledge base, it is a constant 'Work in Progress.' Follow the below steps to build an effective KB.

| Gather | Optimize | Monitor | Re-Organize |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Collect only necessary, helpful, and relevant information. Include both internal and external services offered by the organization.Use Infraon's Incident to KB option or create a KB (article/FAQ etc.) directly. | Keep your content easy to understand and searchable. Ensure that your knowledge base is seamless to navigate through.Add relevant tags to each KB article/documentation and keep the instructions simple and user-friendly. | Monitor and observe entered keywords, understand the usage of your end customer, and use them to enhance User Experience. | Tune your data and clean up your database regularly. Help customers find the information they are looking for effortlessly.Delete/archive old articles and keep your KB clutter-free. |






### Infraon's Knowledge Base

## SLA Management

[SLA](/infraon-help/infinity-user-guide/sla-management/sla)[Profile](/infraon-help/infinity-user-guide/sla-management/profile)






### SLA

An SLA stands for Service Level Agreement. ITIL4 defines SLA as "A documented agreement between a service provider and a customer that defines both the services required and the expected level of service." SLA is a detailed document that defines the standards of services the customer expects from the service provider. SLAs differ across services, vendors, and industries. It is an integral part of a vendor contract because it lists the services agreed upon between the parties and the quality, availability, remedies, and penalties.

In Infraon, the "SLA" module is an SLA-capturing tool. It is not yet implemented as a full-fledged SLA Management tool. It allows the definition of SLA metrics and service details.

#### Benefits of SLA:

* **Sets clear guidelines and expectations -** An SLA sets clear guidelines regarding expectations and commitments.
* **Improved customer service -** Because of the existence of an SLA between two parties, the service provider monitors and measures whether the terms of the service are being met. Thus, the team works efficiently to achieve the deadlines. There will be a decrease in ticket response time, which will improve customer service.
* **Peace of Mind -** An SLA gives customers peace of mind because they have a contract they can refer to in case their demands are unmet.
* **Strengthens Customer Relationships -** The above-mentioned benefits enable a strong relationship between the service provider and the customer.

##### Two Essential Components of an SLA

The two essential components of an SLA are **Metrics** and **Penalties**.

**Metrics -** Metrics are the criteria for measuring services. It is an agreed-upon measurable target between the customer and the service provider. Metrics make it easier to spot SLA breaches.

\***Penalty -** Penalty is a disciplinary measure to be followed if the SLA is breached. A penalty could be imposed for monetary refunds, service credits, etc. These terms are captured in an SLA.

##### Metric

The metric tab creates specific conditions so SLA calculations start, pause, resume, and stop at the right times. To add a Metric, go to the SLA module -> Metric -> Add Metric -> Ticket.

Add the following details:

| Label | Action | Description/Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Name | Name of the Metric. | Give a name for the Metric. |
| Criticality | Select the criticality of the Metric. | Suppose there are many parameters, the system will know which metric to follow with the help of 'Criticality'. |
| Description | Description of the Metric. | |
| Start Condition | Start Condition enables a user to specify the condition under which the SLA will be attached to the ticket and begin metering. Start conditions can be configured to capture the SLA starting from when the ticket was first created or when the ticket was assigned from one team to another. | Suppose a ticket was assigned to team A, and the team realizes it is not in their domain and assigns it to team B. In such cases, \*OLA guidelines help manage the SLA timelines. |
| Close Condition | Close Condition enables a user to specify the condition under which the SLA completes. | |
| Pause Condition | Pause Condition enables a user to specify the conditions under which the SLA metering will be paused. | |
| Resume Condition | Resume Condition enables a user to specify the conditions under which the SLA will resume the metering. The Resume Condition option will be enabled only if the Pause Condition is specified. | |
| Cancel Condition | Cancel Condition enables a user to specify the conditions under which the SLA will be canceled. | |

> \*OLA - An OLA stands for Operational Layer Agreement. It is an internal agreement in which a service provider defines the guidelines for internal teams to meet SLAs.

Once the SLA conditions are specified, click the 'Submit' button to create the Metric.






### Profile

An SLA Profile defines the objectives regarding the quality of service and performance. For example, a Gold profile customer may get a quicker response and resolution than a Silver profile customer. An SLA profile consists of SLA Type, Service Level Targets, and the conditions under which these targets are applicable.

To add an SLA Profile, go to the SLA module -> Profile -> Add SLA Profile -> Ticket. There are three tabs under which the details of a profile are captured.

#### **Profile Details**

In Profile Details, one can specify basic details of the profile like name, type, description, start and end dates, and so on. The description of the fields is given below:

| Label | Action | Description/Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Name | Name of the SLA profile. | Give a name for the SLA profile. For Example, Gold, VIP, and Platinum. |
| SLA Type | Select the type of the SLA. | Service - define the quality of service offered.Performance - define the availability of the services. |
| Status | Select the status of the profile. | The status of the profile can be Active or In-Active. |
| Compliance Target | Set the compliance percentage. | A compliance target is the percent of the performance of the SLA to check if the terms were met over a period of time. |
| Start Date | Start Date of the SLA | |
| End Date | End Date of the SLA | |
| Description | Describe the SLA profile. | |

##### Service Level Target

In this tab, the commitments made by the service provider in terms of availability, response, or resolution times are captured.

* **Business Hours Profile—Business hours are the daily working hours of teams/departments within the organization. Select the business hours profile from the drop-down. Business** hours can be configured in Infraon Configuration -> General Settings -> Business Hours -> Add Profile.

To know more about Business Hours, click here.

* **Target Profile** - This section allows you to define metrics for response and resolution times. Go to Target Profile -> Add New Profile.

| Label | Action | Description/Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Target Profile | Specify a name for the target profile. | |
| \*Select Metric | Select the type of the Metric. | Examples of metrics:Response - Define the time duration within which the customer can expect a response/acknowledgment based on the 'Priority' of the ticket.Resolution - Define the time duration within which the customer can expect a resolution for the ticket based on its 'Priority.' |
| Business Hours | Define the number of minutes, hours, or days required to respond/resolve a ticket based on its priority. | Suppose a ticket with a priority of 'Critical' is newly created, and the response metric is set at 10 mins. The service desk has to respond/acknowledge within 10 mins to the customer. |
| \*Non-Business Hours | Define the number of minutes, hours, or days required to respond/resolve a ticket based on its priority during non-business hours. | |

> \*Non-Business Hours are optional.

> \*Metrics are derived from the Metrics tab of the SLA module. Custom metrics can be defined for conditions like Start, Pause, Resume, etc.

##### Applied For

The 'Applied For' tab allows a user to specify the conditions under which the SLA metrics are applicable.

After entering all the details, click 'Submit' to create the SLA Profile.

An SLA Profile can be edited or deleted after it is created. Deleting an SLA Profile is irreversible.

###### **Default SLA**

Customize default metrics like response and resolution times, and tailor them to your specific operations. Improved flexibility with predefined business hours and effortlessly applied services to meet unique requirements.






## Geomap

Geomap allows for visualization of the location of all the assets by associating a geographic area with GPS coordinates. It enables you to visualize the location of the assets and also provides information about their working condition.

Geomap makes managing assets, identifying opportunities, and providing quick service easy. If the technician's location matches the asset location, assigning the technician becomes straightforward, resulting in a quick resolution. Prompt service, in turn, enhances the customer experience.

### General Settings

The general settings module is a part of Infraon Configuration and is accessible by administrators and other users authorized by administrators.

This module of Infraon consists of three additional modules. They are:

* **Audits:**  Infraon monitors and records every user's actions. Only the administrator can access these audits.
* **Business Hours:**  Configure business hours to control SLAs and better efficient work allocation.
* **Tag Management:**  Tagging is a way of grouping assets, users, etc. Tags can be applied to multiple categories across Infraon.

Let's see each of these in detail.






#### Audits

Infraon records all automated and manual activities that occur within the tool and saves them as Audits.

Audit records information of the user, the action performed, the IP address, and the time stamp when the action was performed.

No actions can be performed from this page.






#### Business Hours

The daily working hours of teams/departments within an organization are called business hours. This, in turn, aids in assigning work based on users' working hours and setting and meeting SLAs.

##### **Add a Business Hour Profile**

When creating a profile, you could choose between specific working days/hours and 24/7 availability.

Use the Exclude Hours option to add a break in the business hours. This can be the weekend, an official lunch hour/break time, or a change in the Technician's shift. SLAs are adjusted as needed.

To view the complete list of holidays applicable to your region, add 'Holiday' or click on import holidays. 'Exclude hours and Holidays' are excluded while calculating SLAs for the ticket.

###### **Instructions to 'Add a Business Hour Profile'**

* Go to Infraon Configuration -> General Settings -> Business Hours.
* Click the 'Add Profile**'** button

| Label | Action | Description/Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Profile Name\* | Give a name to the Business Hour Profile. | Support Team, Main Branch, Tech Support |
| Description | Add a brief description of the profile. | Tech support team from the Head Office. |
| Timezone | Select Timezone applicable for the profile. | Select 'Timezone' based on the team's work location. Multiple business profiles can be created to align to SLAs of multiple teams supporting multiple locations. |
| Work Hours | Use the option to select if the team works 24\*7 or selected working days/hours.24\*7 - Select exclude hours for your team.Select Working Days/Hours - Select weekdays, start and end times. The selected days and hours are taken as official working hours for the organization/team. | For the 'Select Working Days/ Hours' option, there is an option to add multiple Business Hour profiles. This can define business hours on weekends (Saturday/Sunday) or other holidays. |
| Exclude Hours | Add a reason and select weekdays, start, and end times to add exclude hours. | This can be the weekend, an official lunch hour/break time, or a change in the technician's shift.Use the 'Add Exclude Hours'option to add multiple instances. 'Exclude Hours'are excluded while calculating SLAs. |
| Yearly Holiday List | Add Date and Holiday Name to add a specific day as a holiday. | To view the complete list of holidays applicable to your region, add 'Holiday' or click on import holidays.'Holidays'are excluded while calculating SLAs for the ticket. |

Once all the parameters are added, click 'Submit' to save the profile. Business Hour Profiles can be linked to SLA, Reports, and Discovery.  Please refer to the module below for more details.

Repeat the process to add multiple profiles. Business Profiles can be edited or deleted using the respective icons.






#### Tag Management

Tags are simplified identification keywords used to group items or users within Infraon. Tags can be applied to users, assets, Incidents or requests, articles, etc.

##### **Tag Types**

Tagging enables quick grouping of items/users.  At this point in time, tags are added for:

* **Assets** - Tag assets by brand, vendor, location technician, etc.
* **Users** - Tag users by the team, skills, location, service catered, etc.
* **Expertise** - Tag teams (team creation) with   Hardware, Python, Django, or product expertise like washing machines, TV, etc.
* **Services** - Tag services by team, location, category, classification, etc.
* **Incident** - Tag incidents by the team, technician, site, catalogue, criticality, device, etc.
* **Requests** - Tag incidents by the team, technician, site, catalogue, criticality, device, etc.

##### **How to use a tag effectively?**

In a business where the end-users call from multiple locations for support on laptops and desktops, asset tags such as Laptop, Desktop, NY, AU, and IND can be used to assign these incidents to technicians tagged as Laptop, Desktop, NY, AU, and IND.

###### **Instructions to 'Add a Tag'**

* Go to Infraon Configuration -> General Setting ->Tag Management
* Click the '"Add Tag button'

| Label | Action | Description/Example |
| --- | --- | --- |

#### API Registration

APIs or Application Programming Interfaces are added to enable data exchange between Infraon and computers/programs/applications. API integrations are possible with other third-party applications and web services supporting HTTP protocol.

Infraon supports REST API. REST stands for *Representational State Transfer* that adheres to REST architectural constraints. REST serves as a bridge between the client and the server, allowing communication over HTTP. It enables servers to cache responses, resulting in improved application performance.

The REST-API serves as a single point of entry into the system. Before granting access to the application's resources, it encapsulates the business logic and processes all client requests, including authorization, authentication, data sanitization, and other necessary tasks. Infraon supports the below content types:

* application/json
* application/x-www-form-urlencoded
* txt/plain

APIs use authorization to secure client requests accessing data. While integrating third-party APIs, these credentials are provided by the respective API provider. Based on the API, you can select one of the below Auth Types:

* API Key - Uses a key-value pair in the API's request headers or query parameters.
* Basic Auth - Uses a verified username and password with the request.
* Custom Auth - Uses token-based authorization that requires CSRF URL, token, key, username, and password with the request.
* No Auth - Uses when there is no authorization to request data.

##### **API Supported Operations**

* Requests
* Sites
* Technicians
* Assets
* Worklog

##### **Instructions to 'Add API'**

* Go to Infraon Configuration -> General Settings -> API Registration
* Click the 'Add API' button

Users are assigned to multiple teams, and teams are assigned to specific modules, such as a team to manage Incidents or Service Requests or an asset team.

##### **What you see on the screen**

You can add new teams and edit and delete existing ones from this page.

###### **Instructions to 'Add Team'**

Click on the **'**Add Team**'** button in the top right corner.

There are two tabs in the 'Add Team' form. At this point, three types of teams can be created on Infraon.

| Approval | Operation and Technical | Service Desk |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The approval team consists of users who are in charge of approving requests. | The operation and Technical team comprises users performing operational or technical tasks within Infraon. | The Service Desk comprises users who are a part of the Helpdesk/service or support team. This team is generally the first level in in-charge of tickets. |

> Fields marked with \* are mandatory.

There are three options for selecting staff for the team.

| User Tags | Users | Expertise |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Select users based on the user tags (groupings). | Select users directly for the team. | Select users based on their expertise. |

Infraon can be customized with sequential approvals, enabling multi-level authorization to allow a hierarchical approach.

The configuration tab is enabled when adding an Approval or an Operation and Technical Team.

Approval Team - Used to configure.

Operation and Technical Team - Used to configure auto-assignment of tickets.

##### **What is Auto Assignment?**

An alert is raised when a ticket lands in the service desk queue. Either a technician self-assigns it, or a team leader assigns it to the team. With manual intervention, tickets may be picked based on ease of resolution, making it unfair for other technicians. New tickets may also be in the queue for too long while waiting to be assigned, impacting the SLAs. Auto assignment of tickets removes manual intervention, ensuring fairness and timely assignment. Infraon offers three methods to define auto-assignment.

###### **Round Robin**

Round Robin is the simplest way of assignment where tickets are assigned equally to active technicians in a circular order—recommended for businesses where tickets are raised to follow up on orders, requests, etc. Using this to auto-assign tickets helps save time on the manual assignment of tickets.

**Use-case:** An e-commerce business where tickets are raised to know order status, delays in delivery or refund status, etc. Since these are information-based tickets and no troubleshooting is required, the time spent on each ticket is minimal. Using the round-robin method ensures that tickets are assigned equally and orderly.

###### **Load Balancer**

The load-balanced method assigns tickets based on the technician's load and is recommended for businesses offering a wide range of services, where the resolution time is different for each. Using the Load Balanced method ensures the technicians have a balanced workload while working on a ticket. When a new ticket is raised, the technician with the most negligible load is auto-assigned to the technician. Tickets are assigned based on the ticket queue's SLA, priority, and criticality. Thresholds must be defined to select this method.

**Use-case:** A technical support center for a product that offers 24/7 support where tickets are raised throughout the day. Some tickets may be inquiries, while others might have a long resolution. A round-robin method may not make sense here. The load balancer method checks the technician's current load before assigning new tickets. This way, technicians are not burdened with work.

###### **Skill Based**

The Skill-Based method is used when the organization offers multiple categories/levels of support. It is recommended for organizations providing support globally or across a wide range of products/services. Skill-based assignment ensures that the right technician assigns the tickets by matching their skill and level.

**Use-case:** A business that offers support or services on multiple products, regions, and time zones offering multi-lingual support. Here, tickets must be assigned based on the technician's skill. The technician must be skilled in the language the customer selects, know about the product chosen, etc. A skill-based allocation is best suited for this.

### Service Management

* Service Management, also known as ITSM, is an essential part of the lives of service-oriented businesses and organizations. ITSM, traditionally used to deliver technology solutions effectively, has now evolved into service management, which provides business values. Service management can help organizations simplify processes within other teams that rely on technology, such as HR, administration, finance, legal, etc.
* Service Management is an essential module of Infraon that helps organizations follow ITIL or other compliance-related practices while delivering consistent care and attention.  A service-driven organization aims to support strategic business objectives with the support of ITIL.
* While ITIL V3 defined 26 processes across the service lifecycle, in ITIL 4, these 26 processes were replaced by 34 "practices." The noticeable change in ITIL 4 is its definition of service as a means to co-create value by facilitating customer-desired outcomes without undergoing related costs or risks. To achieve this, the ITIL Service Value System (SVS) has been introduced in ITIL 4 to replace the service lifecycle from ITIL v3. In addition to this, ITIL 4 has also introduced four dimensions replacing the 4 Ps of ITILv3:

  * Organizations and People
  * Information and Technology,
  * Partners and Suppliers
  * Value Streams and Processes
* Organizations looking to implement ITIL must know that ITIL defines two types of catalogues for IT Services.  Why do we need two separate catalogues?

#### **What is a catalogue, and why do we need separate catalogues?**

A catalogue is a compilation of items for end-users to select from to simplify their daily requests. Articles from the catalogue can include:

* The organization's IT services include email creation, login credentials, laptop servicing, etc.
* Non-IT services include HR (Onboarding, letters, relieving), finance (Pay Slips, tax forms), and admin (Access cards, cupboard keys).
* Asset requests for active assets like keyboard, monitor, laptop, etc.
* Asset requests for fixed assets like chairs, boards, pedestals, etc.,
* Consumables like batteries, printer cartridges, stationeries, forms, etc.

Service management has two sides: service offering and service requesting. Services are offered using a service catalogue and requested using the business catalogue. Organizations can target a smooth workflow regarding assignments, approvals, and SLAs by having two separate catalogs and simultaneously enhance user experience.

| Label | Service Catalogue | Business Catalogue |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The audience | Meant for the IT or other respective teams to define categories, subcategories, and services to be listed in Business Catalogue. | Meant for end users. Lists out offered products and services as a catalogue, making it readily available for selection by users. |
| Service Perspectives | Contains infrastructure components used to fulfill all listed services like backup, storage, Assets, HR forms, maintenance tools, etc. | Contains user-facing services like Email fixes, IT servicing requests, services for provisioning, products like Mouse, Laptop, etc. |
| Information | Lists out Items and components in detail in addition to teams/individuals available to support these services. | Lists out products/services with descriptions, making it easy for users to select. |
| Value | Facilitates delivery of services in the business catalog in compliance with SLAs. | Facilitates timely access to services enabling user experience. |

To simplify, the service catalogue is the backend of services offered through the business catalogue.

Configuring a service catalogue enables consolidation of services offered and improved productivity levels, thereby enhancing service experience. A Service Catalog is often integrated with a **C**onfiguration **M**anagement **D**ata**B**ase (CMDB), a database of assets or CIs (Configurable Items) owned by the business. Infraon's CMDB is referred to as Assets.

#### How to build an effective service catalogue?

An effective service catalogue must fulfill user requirements, ease technicians' load, and adhere to SLAs. It must also be defined to facilitate self-service.

Step 1: Understand user needs

Step 2: Define service offerings

Step 3: Keep the details crisp, clear, and user-friendly

Step 4: Align offerings with the right audience

Step 5: Setup the right service team

Step 6: Define owners, approvers, and permissions

Step 7: Refine offerings periodically

Add on: Keep an incident template handy.

#### Service Catalogue

The service catalogue is the service offering part of service management. It is the backend of the services provided through the business catalog, i.e., the module where the administrator or catalogue manager defines and manages products or services. These configured items can be viewed, wish-listed, and requested by requesters (internal and external end-users).

A service catalogue is created to maintain a list of components offered as services to the end-user. Components can be used as support to enable services, not as a direct service.

Only authorized staff and users can access the catalogue and perform activities like viewing, adding, modifying, authorizing, and deleting records based on their role.

The administrator or catalogue manager uses a service Catalog to define and manage services, add service categories, and more. Other users can authorize and view catalogue information.

Infraon's Service catalogue offers options to create and publish products or services in detail with descriptions to facilitate structured content for the self-service framework.

##### **What can you do here?**

The Service Catalogue need not necessarily list only the IT components. There are other teams within the organization that provide services to employees, such as HR, Finance, etc. Any request from an end-user can be classified as a service. This includes a request for an email ID, information on HR policy, clarification on Salary Slips, etc.

Service Catalogue comprises

* Service
* Category of service
* Classification and child classification for each category

To define the audience, service owners, cost, and SLAs.

###### **Before adding a Service**

To add a service, the following must be defined.

* **Catalogue** - A branch or department offering the service within the organization. For example, the catalogue can include IT services, asset requests, HR services, admin services, etc.
* **Category** - Multiple categories within each catalog. For example, the IT Services catalogue can be split into categories like Desktop Servicing, Laptop Servicing, Components Servicing, etc.
* **Classification** - Classification for the specific service. For example, classifications can be made based on Desktop Brand or servicing needs such as Memory upgrade, Keyboard replacement, software requirement, and so on within the' Desktop Servicing' category.
* **Service** - The actual Service that is being offered. For example, servicing laptops/desktops, installation of MS office, mouse, offering HR services like HR letters, leave balances, request for a payslip, form 16 from the finance team, etc.
* Once all the above parameters are defined, click on the 'Add Service' button at the top right corner. The 'Add Service' form has four tabs.

  * **Basic Information** - Add basic service information like name, code, description, etc. Align the service to an existing catalogue or choose to add a new Catalogue, Category, or Classification.
  * **Advanced Information** - Add advanced information like cost, tag, overview, features, etc. Information added here enhances the user experience within the self-service portal.
  * **Ownership** - Assign service/business owners, reviewers, approvers, and service team. Define the audience by keeping the service open to all or limiting it to selected requesters/requester tags.
  * **Service Template** - Create a service template to ease the request for service.

Click 'Save.' It is recommended that you keep the service in the 'New' state and 'Draft' status for as long as necessary to define, review, and refine it to describe all service/product aspects to suit requirements.

**Note:**Service must be in 'Published' status to be available on the self-service portal (operational).

**Business Rule :** Defines the business rule for the Infraon system for auto assignment of tickets.

**Escalation:** Defines the escalations process and automatic assignment mechanism are employed in support ticket resolution.

**Customer feedback templates:** Customize templates to collect feedback to improve service quality and customer experience.

Let's see each of these in detail.






#### Business Rule

##### **What is a business rule?**

A business rule for an infraon product refers to a specific guideline or constraint that governs the behavior, processes, or operations within the context of that product's infrastructure. These rules are typically defined and enforced to ensure consistency, compliance, and efficient functioning of the infraon product.

###### **Types in business rule**

There are two types of business rules:

* **Load Balancer:** The ticket allocation system ensures a balanced workload distribution between users. It automatically routes any additional tickets beyond the initial allocation to the following user until the same number of tickets per user is reached.

**For Example**: If user one has seven tickets, and user two has five tickets, the upcoming tickets will be automatically added to user two, as user one already has seven tickets greater than user two.

* **Round Robin:** Despite any existing ticket imbalances, prospective tickets raised are sequentially assigned to the first user, disregarding the need for a balanced distribution among users.

**For Example,** User One has five tickets, and User Two has three tickets; prospective tickets are automatically assigned to User One even though User Two has fewer tickets.

##### **Instructions to add business rules**

* Go to Infraon Configuration> Infraon Automation> Business rule
* Click the ‘Add’ Button

The auto-assignment process in L2 support, where technicians (U4, U5, U6) are categorized based on their levels. When opting for L1 auto-assignment, the system follows a sequential assignment of technicians (U1, U2, U3, and so on) for customer ticket resolution.

The SAAS team's auto-assignment mechanism to handle hardware issues. When a problem arises in the service, the team provides hardware support. In the event of hardware issues reported by developers, an expert L1 person is assigned based on load balancing or round robin, ensuring efficient resolution of customer tickets.






##### Manual Service Mapping

This functionality empowers administrators to define automatic ticket assignment rules based on impacted services and requester tags, enhancing the workflow and improving service delivery.

###### **How does it work**

Business rules automate ticket assignments based on predefined criteria. They are configured to:

####### **Assign tickets based on impacted service:**

Tickets associated with a specific impacted service (e.g., hardware diagnostics) can be automatically assigned to a designated team or technician based on expertise level.

####### **Assign tickets based on the requester tag:**

Tickets created by users of a particular requester tag (e.g., front desk) can be routed to a predefined team or technician.

###### **Creating Business Rules with Manual Service Mapping**

This section guides admins through creating business rules with manual service mapping.

####### **Define the Business Rule**

* Assign the rule a clear and descriptive name (e.g., "Hardware Diagnostics—Assign to IT Team Level 1").
* Select the type of rule (e.g., "Impact Service").
* Briefly explain the rule's purpose (e.g., "This rule automatically assigns tickets related to hardware diagnostics to IT Team Level 1 technicians").

####### **Configure Impact Service Mapping**

* Select the specific service impacted by the ticket (e.g., "Hardware Diagnostics").
* Choose the logical operator for the rule (e.g., "equals").
* **Assign To:**

  * **Group/Team:** Specify the team responsible for addressing tickets related to the impacted service (e.g., "IT Team").
  * **Expertise:** Define the specific expertise required for handling tickets (e.g., "Hardware").
  * **Level:** Select the appropriate technician level within the assigned team (e.g., "Level 1").

######## **Example:**

Considering a scenario where an IT team handles hardware diagnostics. Creating a business rule with the following configuration ensures tickets related to hardware diagnostics are automatically assigned to IT Team Level 1 technicians:

* **Business Rule Name:** Hardware Diagnostics - Assign to IT Team Level 1
* **Type:** Impact Service
* **Description:** This rule assigns tickets related to hardware diagnostics to IT Team Level 1 technicians.
* **Impact Service:** Hardware Diagnostics
* **Operator:** Equals
* **Assign To:**

  * **Group/Team:** IT Team
  * **Expertise:** Hardware (Optional)
  * **Level:** Level 1

####### **Business Rules for Requester Tags**

Business rules can also be based on requester tags. Here's how to create a rule for a specific requester tag:

* Assign Tickets from the Front Desk to the Procurement Team Level 1
* **Add the respective** Requester Tag as Front Desk Manager.
* **Then Assign To:**

  * **Group/Team:** Procurement Team
  * **Level:** Level 1 Technician

######## **Example:**

This rule ensures any ticket created by someone with the "Front Desk Manager" tag is automatically assigned to the Level 1 Technician within the Procurement Team.






#### Escalation

##### **What is escalation?**

The escalation process and automatic assignment mechanism are employed in support ticket resolution. When a ticket is raised, it is initially assigned to an L1 user, if L1 cannot resolve the ticket, it is escalated to the appropriate escalation team. The escalation occurs from L1 to L2 and L3 in descending order. Automatic escalation is triggered in L1, with the system selecting a user for escalation. The escalated team provides a response time for ticket resolution, such as 50 minutes for L1 and 30 minutes for L2, allowing multiple scheduled attempts to resolve the ticket within the given time frame.

##### **Instructions to add the escalation**

* Go to Infraon Configuration> Infraon Automation> Escalation
* Click the ‘Add’ Button

To the ‘Escalation’ page. Refer to the table for information.

| Label | Action | Description/Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Escalation Name | Add your Escalation name | The process of automatically routing or notifying higher-level authorities or individuals when certain conditions or thresholds are met, ensuring timely attention to critical issues or tasks. |
| Priority | Select the priority from the dropdown | Prioritize the ticket, critical, high, or medium also you can select all |
| Team Name | Select the team from the dropdown | Team Name refers to the designated identifier given to a specific team or group responsible for handling escalated issues or tasks within the system. |
| When | Select from the dropdown | The ticket not resolved option is available and the user should select the option while creating the escalation. |

Click the ‘**Submit’** button.

**Note:** An automated escalation and assignment process in a multi-level support system consists of three levels. When creating an escalation, the priority is selected, and the system automatically assigns the first available assignee.

For Example: Here are three options: After 25 minutes (L2), changing the assignee, notifying without assigning or notifying, and changing the assignee to L2. After 30 minutes, the assignee is changed to L3; after 60 minutes, it is changed to L4. If a ticket is raised with an L1 user, after 25 minutes, the system triggers an email to automatically assign an L2 user from the pool of available options.

#### Workflow

Workflows act as visual flowcharts of processes within Infraon. They are created to automate and visualize a multi-step process as a sequence of activities, including assigning tickets, triggering an email or SMS notification, requesting approvals, etc. With Infraon, workflows can be created using simple drag-and-drop elements that can be added as a flowchart to indicate the flow of activities in a sequence.

##### **How to Build a Workflow?**

At this point, you can configure workflow for Incidents. Workflows can be triggered using single or multiple conditions within the service catalogue.

###### **Components of Workflow**

To build a workflow, the below components must be defined:

* **Trigger** - Triggers are the initial action(s) that trigger the workflow. One or more triggers can be configured. At this point, only service catalogue-based triggers can be added.
* **Conditions** - One or more conditions can be added to be validated while executing. To add a condition, define

  * **Operand** - Operand is the parameter that needs to be validated. In this case, Service Catalogue.
  * **Value** - Value of the Operand or the parameter's value to validate.
  * **Relation** - (and/or) Relation between the conditions (applicable only if multiple conditions are selected)
* **Build Form** - Consists of drag-and-drop HTML elements. You can use it to add custom fields to the incident form based on your organizational, compliance, or process requirements.  Additionally, section layouts can be changed, configured, or deleted to suit the need. You can preview sections to understand the placement of sections within the incident form.

This consists of your workflow's drag-and-drop elements, such as state, action, and condition. It helps create a customized workflow based on your organizational, compliance, or process requirements.

Using the 'Save' option saves the workflow. When the workflow changes and conditions are published, they are added.

**Note:** Workflows must always start with an 'Open' state and end with 'Closed.' All other states are optional.






##### Advanced Options

Advanced configurations in workflow include:

**Field Constraints** - Used to define role-based privileges on the incident components. Fields can be hidden or made mandatory for selected statuses and roles. Worklog can be made mandatory for roles and statuses. For example, for the role of an IT Support Operator, while the incident status is 'Working *(In Progress)*,all closure-related fields *(Closure Note, Closed By, Close Type, Agreed Closure Date, and Actual Closure Date)* can be hidden, and fields like Diagnosis and Note can be made mandatory. Multiple constraints can be added to define limitations for all roles.

**Permissions -** This enables or disables role-based permissions for Incident actions. Actions like commenting on the wall, KB searches, adding attachments, adding tasks, defining relations, and escalating can be customized. For example, an API user can be restricted from adding attachments or tasks.

Workflows can be edited or deleted using the respective action icons.

  * An anomaly is triggered only when real-time data breaches these thresholds.
  * By default, predictions are generated for the next 2 weeks.






#### Blacklist and Whitelist

In the realm of software and application security, two key concepts arise: blacklisting and whitelisting. Though seemingly opposite, these methods play crucial roles in safeguarding your system from unwanted programs and vulnerabilities.

##### **What is blacklisting?**

Blacklisting operates on the principle of exclusion. A blacklist is a curated list of programs deemed undesirable, malicious, or unauthorized. Software identified on the blacklist is then blocked from installation or execution on a system.

Here are some common reasons why software might be blacklisted:

* Known malware or viruses: These programs are designed to harm your system, steal data, or disrupt operations.
* Unwanted applications: Some software might be disruptive or inappropriate for certain environments.
* Pirated software: Using illegal copies of software can be harmful and is often blacklisted.
* Vulnerable applications: Programs with known security flaws pose a risk and might be blacklisted until patched.

##### **What is whitelisting?**

Whitelisting, on the other hand, takes the opposite approach. Instead of listing what's bad, it defines what's good. A whitelist is a curated list of programs explicitly permitted to be installed or run on a system. Any software not on the whitelist is automatically restricted.

Whitelisting offers several advantages:

* Enhanced security: Only authorized and vetted software can run, significantly reducing the risk of malware and unauthorized access.
* Simplified management: Administrators have complete control over what software is allowed, making it easier to maintain a secure environment.
* Improved compliance: Whitelisting can help organizations comply with specific security regulations or internal policies.

###### **Steps to add the configuration**

* Go to Infraon Portal -> Infraon Configuration -> IT Operations -> Blacklist and Whitelist.
* On the top right corner of the page, navigate to the ‘Add’ button to add a new configuration.
* Enter the below details in the respective dialog boxes.

| Label | Action | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Type | Select the appropriate from the drop-down box below. | Example – Software, etc. |
| Profile | | Enter a profile name to the configuration. |
| Description | | Enter a brief description about the configuration. |
| Blacklist | Select the appropriate from the drop-down box below. | |
| Whitelist | Select the appropriate from the drop-down box below. | |






#### CLI Jobs

CLI Jobs/sessions in NCCM create direct CLI sessions (SSH or TELNET) between the Device and the User through the NCCM application. Using a CLI Job, the user can write direct commands on devices similar to the Putty application.

The user will request a CLI connection by inputting the Device IP Address, Device account username (in case of SSH), and the reason for the connection. Based on the user’s role (administrator privileged, CLI whitelisted, or normal user), the CLI job will either open a direct connection to the device or put the CLI request into the **Request Queue** for Change Approval process.

The CLI Job will audit all device user commands, including device response. NCCM does not provide command restrictions in case of Policy violations. The NCCM Policy engine remediates policy violation commands periodically.

***This is a privilege-based feature:***

The user can access, view, add, edit, delete, execute, and export only if the administrator has given them privileges. These will be defined under roles and privileges.

The user will be white-listed for CLI operations (no need for Approval) only if the “CLI Job Pre-Approved” permission is enabled in the Account Roles and Privileges.

From the **“Jobs”** menu, click **‘CLI Jobs/Sessions’**

* All CLI Jobs, including history connection and live session, are listed with their active status.

##### **What you see on the screen**

Clicking the session details icon will display live audits.

**Note:** CLI Jobs requested by Non-Whitelisted users will be submitted for approval and executed only when approved. However, Whitelisted users' CLI Jobs will be executed without approval.

Using this audit, the administrator can identify the changes, the user responsible for them, and the time of the change.

CLI Jobs not approved within the expiry time will get to the Expired State, and the expiration duration can be configured using System Parameters.

#### Maintenance

Maintenance refers to the ongoing process of inspecting, repairing, and optimizing equipment or software to ensure reliability, performance, and longevity. Thus, maintenance minimizes downtime and prevents potential issues.

Maintenance involves the deliberate shutdown of a device for a specific purpose or action, often driven by a scheduled event or a particular requirement. During maintenance, alarms are suspended, and polling operations are halted on the device undergoing maintenance. This measure is undertaken to prevent the occurrence of extraneous alerts and to ensure that any unnecessary activities are averted, enhancing the overall efficiency of the maintenance operation.

##### **What you see on the screen**

Refer to the following table for more information:

| Label | Description/ Example |
| --- | --- |
| Reason | Mention the reason for the maintenance |
| No. Of Assets | Mention the number of assets for maintenance |
| Status | Status is changed as per the maintenance. |
| Maintenance Window | The date will be displayed i.e. To – From date. |

Click on the ‘action’; tab and click the ‘edit’ or ‘delete’ icon.

In Edit, there are two tabs mentioned below:

**Asset Details** | Schedule

* Write the reason for the maintenance.
* Select ‘Mask Alarm’ or ‘Stop polling’ and click ‘Next’

**Mask Alarm**: A mask alarm is a condition where no alarm signals are intended to activate. This implies that the system operates under circumstances that prevent any alarm triggers.

**Stop Polling:** Stop polling refers to an elective intermediary action positioned between the "mask alarm" and itself. When the verification is selected, polling operations are suspended; however, if the checkbox remains unmarked, polling continues, though an alarm won't be generated even if it aligns with the threshold.

Asset Details | **Schedule**

* Click on the ‘Calendar’ icon to select the start time and select the time.
* Click on the ‘Calendar’ icon to select the end Time and select the time.
* Click ‘Submit’

Maintenance can be deleted by clicking the ‘delete’ icon from the action tab.

**Note**: A corresponding maintenance icon becomes visible on the device interface when a device enters a maintenance state. Selecting the maintenance icon cesses polling operations; if the checkbox is activated, polling is suspended, and data remains empty.

The NCCM module of Infraon consists of additional modules listed further.

##### **Configuration Download**

* **Calendar View** – Calendar View provides a daily activity summary, including successful, failed, completed, and total configurations processed.
* **Configuration Parameters** - These parameters encompass various aspects of the device's operation, including network settings, security policies, access controls, and performance configurations.
* **Configuration Profile -** A configuration profile is a template or predefined set of configuration settings that network administrators can create and customize with information like device details and connection protocols for SSH and Telnet.
* **Configuration Search** - Configuration Search specifically focuses on download jobs, allowing users to view or export the Startup or Running configurations within these jobs to identify any configuration.
* **Download Jobs** - Download jobs are tasks that retrieve configurations from network devices for backup, analysis, auditing, or comparison.
* **OS Image** - OS images are used primarily for managing and deploying configuration changes across network devices such as routers, switches, and firewalls.
* **OS Image Download Schedular** - This feature compares the configuration data by downloaded version or file.

##### **Configuration Upload**

* **Configuration Template** - Configuration templates hold the commands for uploading jobs and making changes to network devices, including provisioning, OS upgrades, creating or deactivating services, and any other change.

##### **Utilities**

* **Configuration Comparison** - This feature compares the configuration data by downloaded version or file.
* **Configuration File Compare** - Compares the Configuration File provided by the user.
* **Generate MD5** - Generate MD5 Key.

##### **Policies**

A policy is a statement of intent implemented as a procedure or protocol. A governance body generally adopts it within an organization.

Policies defined by the organization for internal reference are known as Baseline Policies. In contrast, policies defined by external bodies or organizations based on the nature of an organization's business are known as **Compliance Policies.**

Policies can be categorized into three sections:

* **Rule** **–** A simple condition or a basic checkpoint.
* **Rule Group -** A collection of rules.
* **Policy -** A collection of rule groups.

**Rules** are simple conditions used as basic checkpoints. Multiple category rules are clubbed to form a Rule Group, which meets a **Compliance Policy.**

NCCM enables **Rule configuration, Rule Group Configuration, and Policy configuration.** Some policies, like NIST, PCI DSS v3.2, etc., are preconfigured on NCCM. The rules must be added first to add a new policy, then grouped together and added into a Policy. When NCCM runs policy check:

* **Rule Check –** Rule Information, Match Criteria, and remedy Action are configured here.
* **Rule Group check –** Selected rules (per the above configuration) are checked on the Devices according to the IP range, Device Vendor, andDevice configured here.
* **Policy Check –** Selected Rule Groups are executed based on the Policy Start and End dates and the schedule configured here.

**Note:** Each policy is configured with multiple rules and rule groups to ensure the configurations are per compliance and/or golden template.

##### **CLI Access Profile**

* **Authentication Profile** - This profile manages user authentication for accessing network devices via CLI. It verifies user identity before granting access, ensuring only authorized users can initiate CLI sessions. The Authentication Profile allows users to use SSO (Single Sign-On) to access network devices as per the configurations.

* **Authorization Profile** – This profile defines user access levels and permissions for network devices, ensuring only authorized users can execute commands or modify configurations.

It integrates the AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting) security framework, aligning with NCCM’s Block, Notify, and Terminate actions to enforce security policies by restricting unauthorized actions, alerting admins, or terminating sessions when necessary.

Let's see each one in detail:






##### Baseline Scheduler

The Baseline Configuration module in Infraon Network Configuration and Change Management (NCCM) allows users to establish and manage stable configurations for critical network devices. When a configuration version is identified as stable, flexible, and reliable—such as the 2nd version—it can be labeled as a baseline.

This baseline serves as a reference point, making it easy to revert to a known, stable state if any subsequent changes, like in a 3rd version, prove unnecessary or problematic. Users can quickly identify and restore preferred configurations using the Baseline Configuration module, ensuring their network infrastructure's consistent stability and reliability.

This feature simultaneously changes the baseline configuration for a single or multiple device.

**Note:**

* We can choose the previous version or download it for the baseline setting.
* If the Configuration is selected as “Last Successful download” and the date is not chosen, the previous version or previous successful download will be taken as the baseline setting.
* If “Date” is chosen, the previous version or successful download will be used as the baseline settings based on the selected date.

**Example:**

Copy

```
For Previous Version:
Total versions of the device: 48 versions
Date: 10-02-2019 (On 10th Feb, the last version was 40)
Previous Version: 10
The baseline set version should be “30”

For Previous Download:
Total versions of the device: 48 versions
Date: 10-02-2019 (On 10th Feb, total download was 5)
Previous Download: 4
The baseline set should be the first download that happened on Feb 10th
```

This feature facilitates the swift identification of intentional and accidental changes, aiding in troubleshooting and ensuring policy adherence.

###### **What you see on the screen**

Select any two configurations and Click full screen to compare Configurations:

* Click the compare icon from the comparison window to toggle between displaying the difference between configurations and all configurations.
* Export the result into a PDF.
* Click on the cross icon to close the result window.

**Note:** The configuration file supports only the following formats: txt, cfg, and conf. The maximum file size is 2 MB, and the aspect ratio must be 4:1.






##### Configuration Parameters

Configuration parameters are essentially variables with specific functions within a tool. They act as adjustable settings, allowing users to tailor the tool's behavior to their needs. The complete set of these variables is collectively known as the "configuration parameters."

Compiled languages typically use static variables for configuration, meaning they have a lifespan covering the entire program's execution. This is like pre-determining the settings before starting a journey. In contrast, interpreted languages allocate configuration variables dynamically during declaration, as their values might not be known in advance. Imagine adjusting navigation points mid-journey based on new information.

This is a Privilege-based feature: The user can access, view, add, edit, delete, and execute only if the administrator has granted them privileges. This will be defined under roles and privileges.

* To export the search result to Microsoft Excel, click.
* Save the file in the required folder.






##### Configuration Template

Configuration templates can be used to make configuration changes on networking devices, such as “Provisioning,” “OS Upgrade,” “Service Creation,” “Service Deactivation,” and “any change.”

###### **Template Execution**

* Template is a Collection of commands (one or more) with zero or more variables to be executed on devices for specific operations (like ACL Modification, Route ADD, Interface NAC configuration, Interface IP Change, Interface Enable Disable, SNMP/LLDP/CDP enable or Disabling, OS Upgrade). By substituting different values (to variables) for different Devices, the user can reuse the same template for similar operations on multiple devices. Device Credentials, Device Interface Name/IP Address, and command inputs will become a variable portion in the command template.
* Templates are vendor and OS-type specific, which means separate templates must be built for the same operation on two different vendor devices or for two different OS Types of the same vendor. This is due to a difference in the command syntax and command formats for the same operation on two vendor devices.
* Apart from the command portion, Templates also contain information about the Vendor, OS Type, Series, and Model where the template can run, along with the ACL configuration that defines who can manage the Templates.
* Once the Configuration Template is built, the user can execute the Templates on devices using the Upload Job functionality.
* The Configuration Template (Network Diagnosis type) can be used in the Network Diagnosis functionality to Check the Device’s operational data and for simple configurations like Crypto cache clearing, daily diagnosis check, etc. (which do not affect and are not part of the Device Configuration).
* Configuration Template command portion should be written in XML format.

The Configuration Template inherits Jinja2 Template standards, and the user gets all the benefits of Jinja2 Template, such as Data Types (Integer, Boolean, List), Control Statements (If—elif—else, for loop, while Loop), and Operator conditions (=, !=, >, =, =, etc.).

**Note:** The same Template framework and fundamental is followed in

* Configuration Profile - Used by Configuration Download Job to download Configurations, Inventories, and Operation Data.
* OS Image Download and Upgrade
* Configuration Triggers
* Policy Rule – Command Execution Scope
* Policy Remedy Execution
* CLI (Command Line Interface) Job

Users will be given Direct CLI (SSH or Telnet) access to the Devices from the NCCM Application (like a Gateway process) for changing configurations.






###### What you see on the screen

This is a privilege-based feature: The user will be able to access, view, add, edit, delete, execute, and export only if the administrator has given them privileges. This will be defined under roles and privileges.

The Configuration Template Grid page lists all templates created by the user and also the templates assigned to the same user by an admin or template management full-privileged user.

The **Access Control List** feature in this module lets admin-privileged users decide who can view, edit, or delete any specific templates in NCCM.

####### **Configuration Template Grid shows**

* Template ID - To know the creation sequence (recently created or old).
* Name of Template - The name will be unique and will be used in other features while using the Template.
* Vendor – The Vendor Device where this template can RUN (Vendor Specific).
* OS Type – The Vendor Device OS Type where this Template can only RUN (OS specific).

  * In case the Template can RUN on all OS Types of the same Vendor, Input the OS Type as **‘ALL TYPE.’**

Copy

```
For example, CISCO IOS, IOS XE, NXOS, IOSXR, and ASA may use different command
syntaxes for the same operation.
```

* Type of Template—NCCM supports 9 Types of Templates, each of which will be explained in detail in the following sections.
* Active Status—Enabled/Disabled—During execution, this flag does not impact Jobs set as Disabled (template disabled) but already assigned to an Upload Job. On the other hand, Disabled Templates will not be allowed to be used in New Upload Job Creation.
* Execution Ready or Production Status—It should be in the Ready State to use in the Upload Job for a configuration change.
* Approval Required Flag - The value will always be Yes (Approval is always required).
* Actions – There are two action icons displayed here – Execute & Quick Execute.

**Note:** When the Template is used in the Upload Job by a *whitelisted* user or *Approver*, the Approval Process is bypassed, and the job is executed directly.

* Created User – The user who created the Template.
* Description – Template description that defines the operation purpose.






###### How to write Command Portion in Template

**NCCM supports two ways of writing commands in Template**

1) Plain command format (Writing Device Command as it is)

1. In plain command format, the user writes the device commands defined by the vendor. This format will be used only inside the Command Execution & Network Diagnosis template type but not in Download Job Profiles, OS Upgrade Job, Configuration Trigger, Policy Rules, and Remedy.
2. Though it is simple to write the template in this format, it is not recommended since it does not allow additional information to be added to the command, such as command timeout, response prompt, and error check condition on response.
3. The timeout for each command using plain command format is always 30 seconds, and each command takes the full 30 seconds even if the execution has been completed before.

2) XML Command Format

1. In XML command format, each command is enclosed in an XML node, and additional input to the command, like command timeout, prompt, expected pattern, previous match, and action, is added to the XML node properties.
2. The XML command format is recommended for all NCCM features, including Download, Upload, Upgrade, and Diagnosis.

Sample command portion for changing Device hostname in plain text format and XML format:

| Plain Format | XML Format |
| --- | --- |
| conf thostnamenewnameexit | conf t
hostname
newnameexit |

In the above example, the plain format takes the device command as it is the same way the command is executed using Putty or extreme application. Still, in XML Format, each device command will be placed inside the XML node “Data” section, and other information in the XML node property section.

**XML Command Syntax**

Copy

```
<command property1=”value” property2=”value”> Device Command </command>
                           ————————————————   ——————————————
                          Command Properties  Actual Command
```

**XML Command Sample**

Copy

```
<command prompt=”#” timeout=”10”>hostname newname</command>
```

The device command for every device will be inside the Data portion of the XML Node, and the additional properties or information will be inside XML’s property portion. The property value must always be inside the Double quotes character.

NCCM supports the following properties:

* timeout - value (in seconds). Every command execution is considered complete until the prompt pattern value is matched or till the timeout second count is reached.
* prompt - is generally the last character of the **command response** that informs the command execution completion of a Device. When the response from the Device does not match the prompt, command execution is considered as COMMAND ERROR.

Copy

```
prompt=”#”
```

a. The prompt can be a single character, a word, or a line.

Copy

```
prompt=” #”
prompt=”Router27#”
prompt=”[Are you confirm the reboot action]?”
```

b. The prompt value is always a regex pattern, and it can be escaped using \ to make an exact match. Below example. (Dot) regex character is escaped with \ to consider it literally as ‘.’ (Dot) and not as a regex pattern.

Copy

```
prompt=”\.”
```

Follow the URL <https://regex101.com/> to verify or check the regex pattern before saving the template.

c. The prompt also supports multiple patterns (multiple single characters or multiple words) to match the command execution completion

Copy

```
prompt=”[#,>,\$]”
prompt=”[Username, login, User]”
```

d. When the given prompt is not matched within the specified timeout seconds, NCCM will declare it a Command error and stop or continue the execution based on Task IP/Command continuation input from Upload Job task input.

* “action” property is used to

a. Inform NCCM that the exit command is executed and to not wait for a prompt.

Copy

```
action=”exit”
```

b. Inform NCCM to store the result of the command for storing the device's configuration output and copy the command output for Trigger parsing.

Copy

```
action=”output-to-store”
```

* The “shell” property is used to Inform NCCM to open a remote session (TELNET or SSH) from a Device for further command executions.

Copy

```
shell=”remote”
<command      shell="remote"       prompt="Password">     ssh     -o
StrictHostKeyChecking=no     -o            UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null
{{Profile.ssh_loginname}}@{{Device.IPaddress}}     -p     {{Profile.ssh_port}}
</command>
```

* The “error\_pattern” property checks the command response; if the pattern values match the command response, command execution is considered COMMAND ERROR. Similar to the prompt property, error\_pattern can take multiple values.

**Note:** The prompt property checks for command completion; however, the error\_pattern property checks whether the response is as expected.

Copy

```
error_pattern="[Unknown command, Invalid Command]"
```

**Example:** when the “copy tftp” command is not supported by a device, the response will be %Error opening tftp, and the error\_pattern to catch the error will be

Copy

```
error_pattern="[%Error opening tftp]"
```

The properties below also follow the same principle as the error\_pattern.

* The “expected\_pattern” property checks the command response; if the pattern value does not match the command response, command execution is considered a COMMAND ERROR.

Copy

```
expected_pattern="[bgp is enabled]"
```

* The “expected\_any\_response” property checks the command response; if the device does not respond to any data, command execution is considered a COMMAND ERROR. The value of property is not required, and hence input can be empty double quotes

Copy

```
expected_any_response=""
```

* The “expected\_empty\_response” property checks the command response; if the device responds with any data, command execution is considered a COMMAND ERROR. The value of a property is not required, and hence, the input can be empty double-quotes

Copy

```
expected_empty_response=""
```

* The “expected\_count\_response” property checks the command response; if the device response line does not equal the count value data, command execution is considered a COMMAND ERROR. The value of the property is the response line count. The count can be any number

Copy

```
expected_count_response="5"
```

NCCM expects a 5-line response.

* The “expected\_count\_response” property checks the command response; if the device response line does not equal the count value data, command execution is considered COMMAND ERROR. The value of the property is the response line count. The count can be any number.

Copy

```
expected_count_response="!5"
```

NCCM expects the response to be anything other than 5 lines.

* The “expected\_count\_response” property checks the command response; if the device response line is less than 6, command execution is considered COMMAND ERROR. The value of the property is the count of lines. The count can be any number.

Copy

```
expected_count_response=">5"
```

NCCM expects the response to be greater than 5 lines.

* The “expected\_count\_response” property checks the command response; if the device response line exceeds 4, command execution is considered COMMAND ERROR. The value of the property is the count of lines. The count can be any number.

Copy

```
expected_count_response="=5"
```

NCCM expects the response to be more than 4 lines.

* The “expected\_count\_response” property checks the command response; if the device response line exceeds 5, command execution is considered COMMAND ERROR. The value of the property is the count of lines. The count can be any number.

Copy

```
expected_count_response="<=5"
```

NCCM expects the response to be less than 6 lines

* The “type” property stores the command response under property value. NCCM stores the command output in the Operation Data store.

**For example:**

If the output of the command shows that the IP interface brief is required to be stored in NCCM as an **Interface Brief**, the XML command should be written as

Copy

```
<command prompt=”#” timeout=”5” type=”Interface Brief”> show IP
interface    brief</command>
```

Sample command to shut down an interface in plain text and XML format.

| Plain Format | XML Format |
| --- | --- |
| conf tint Gi 0/0shutdownexit | conf t
 int Gi 0/0
shutdown
exit |

Sample command to enable syslog in plain text format and XML format.

| Plain Format | XML Format |
| --- | --- |
| conf t
logging source-interface
Loopback100
end
write memory | conf t
 logging sourceinterface Loopback100
end
write
memory |

Below are some sample commands to replace the Device configuration file from the NCCM server.

Copy

```
<command prompt="\]\?">copy tftp:running-config</command>
<command prompt="\]\?">{{Global.managementIP}}</command>
<command prompt="\]\?">{{Job.uploadfilename}}</command>
<command prompt="[\],#]" timeout="300">running-config</command>
<command previous_match="\]" prompt="#" timeout="300">yes</command>
<command action="exit" prompt="">exit</command>
```

***Note:*** Plain text commands cannot be written since the timeout of some commands is more than 30 seconds.

NCCM also supports writing Comments inside the command portion to understand commands better. To define a line as a comment, add # character at the beginning of a line.

Example for writing Comments inside commands:

Copy

```
###### Make Terminal Len 0terminal length 0
<command    prompt="#" timeout="60">terminal length 0</command>
###### Copy the Image to Flash
<command    prompt="]\?" timeout="60">copy tftp flash:</command>
###### Remove boot system
<command    prompt="#" timeout="60">no boot system</command>
```

**Note:**At the time of execution, NCCM ignores all lines starting with # (comment lines)

####### **NCCM Variable Substitution**

NCCM follows the **Jinja2 Template** engine for converting **command templates** into actual commands. Jinja2 Template engine provides features like

* Variable substitution

  * For substituting specific values for specific Devices
* Variable declaration
* Data structures like Integer, Boolean, List, and Dictionary
* Loop Statements like

  * For o While
  * Do while
* Conditional Statements like

  * If
  * If else
  * If elif else
* Conditional operators like

o =

o !=

o in

o not in

o > and >=

o < and <=

######## Variable Substitution:

Variables are **command inputs** given by a user dynamically during the execution time.

For example, if the user wants to change the hostname in Cisco devices, the command syntax will be

Copy

```
###### hostname <New Hostname>
hostname is the command and <New hostname> is the variable or
input portion to hostname command
```

Through variable substitution, the single template is enough to change the hostname of all devices with the same Vendor and OS Type configured in the template; otherwise, each device requires a separate template.

To substitute a variable, follow the below steps based on the condition applicable:

1) Use “Double Curly Brackets” before and after the variable {{ }}, only if the variable is not inside Jinja2 statements

Copy

```
<command prompt=”#” timeout=“5”>hostname {{Runtime.hostame}}
</command>
```

*Runtime* is a substitution object.

######## **NCCM Substitution Objects in Template:**

NCCM supports 10 types of **substitution objects** for Variable substitution within the configuration template

1) Runtime object

The runtime object will be used in Configuration Upload and Network Diagnosis activities. Runtime object variables will be converted into user input form to get values while configuring the upload task or Network Diagnosis creation.

Copy

```
{{Runtime.hostname}}
```

2) Global object

All Global parameters configured in NCCM are available through the Global object for Variable substitution.

Copy

```
{{Global.managementIP}}
```

3) Type object

Defines the field based on the variable type specified, such as Text Area, Text field, DropDown, and Multi DropDown.

Copy

```
Type.Speed=DropDown
```

4) Default object

I defined the default value for Type Object here.

Copy

```
Default.Speed=10,100,1000
```

5) Remark object

Displays the Text on mouse hover on the Variable Name.

Copy

```
Remark.Speed=enter speed of interface
```

6) Optional object

If the variable is declared ‘Optional’, the input for the field is not mandatory.

Copy

```
Optional.VariableName
```

7) Check object

Ensures that the Input format matches the defined format.

Copy

```
In Textfield, it should allow only 1 to 255 ^([1-9]|[1-9][0-9]|[1-2][0-5][0-5])$
```

8) LOCAL\_SHELL object

The LOCAL\_SHELL object gets values from the LOCAL\_ACCOUNT profile, configured in the Device credential for Variable substitution.

Copy

```
{{LOCAL_SHELL.username}}
```

9) Device object

The device object gets values from the Device database of the corresponding Device where command execution occurs.

Copy

```
{{Device.IPaddress}}
```

10) Interface object

The interface object gets values from the **Device Interface database** of the corresponding Device where command execution takes place.

Copy

```
{{Interface.name}}
{{Interface.description}}
```

11) Job object

Job object gets values from the Job Database (Upload or Download Job) of the corresponding Device where command execution occurs.

Copy

```
{{Job.name}}
```

12) Profile object

Profile object gets values from Profile Database (Configuration Profile) of the corresponding Device where command execution occurs.

Copy

```
{{Profile.download_profile.user_name}}
```

13) Trigger object:

Trigger object gets values from Configuration Trigger Database of corresponding Trigger name used in Configuration Template.

Copy

```
{{Trigger.triggername}}
```

**Note:**A template can have more than one Trigger variable.

14) Profile object:

Profile object gets values from the Device Credential Database of the corresponding Device (Device Credential) where command execution will occur.

Copy

```
{{Profile.ssh_loginname}}
```

15) Time object:

Time object gets values from the NCCM server based on current time, which is for substituting time values in a template during execution

Copy

```
{{Time.now}} – Time in unix epoc format
{{Time.YYYYMMDD}} – Time in YYYY MM DD format
{{Time.uniquestring}} – Unique string
```

16) Directly writing variable, if a variable is inside Jinja2 expression statement **{% %}**

Copy

```
{% if Runtime.hostname. == “router27” %}
```






###### Conditioning in Template

NCCM supports condition-based Templating using “if,” “if else,” and “if elif else” conditional statements

A. ”If” Condition:

Copy

```
{% if Runtime.interface_name == "GigabitEthernet0/0"    %}
            IP address 192.168.1.1 255.0.0.0
             no shutdown
{%    endif    %}
```

B. ”If else” Condition:

Copy

```
{% if Runtime.interface_name == "GigabitEthernet0/0" %}
             IP address 192.168.1.1 255.0.0.0
             no    shutdown
{% else %}
             IP address    192.168.2.1    255.0.0.0
              no    shutdown
{%    endif    %}
```

C. ”If elif else” Condition:

Copy

```
{% if  Runtime.interface_name == "GigabitEthernet0/0" %}
              IP address 192.168.1.1 255.0.0.0
              no shutdown
{% elif Runtime.interface_name == "GigabitEthernet0/1"    %}
               IP address 192.168.1.1 255.0.0.0
               no shutdown
{% else %}
               IP address 192.168.2.1 255.0.0.0
               no shutdown
{% endif %}
```

####### **Looping in Template:**

NCCM supports loop-based Templating using “for” loop statements

”For Loop” Condition:

Copy

```
{% for interface_name in Runtime.interface_names %}
              {% if {{interface_name}} == "GigabitEthernet0/0" %}
                              IP address 192.168.1.1 255.0.0.0
                              no shutdown
               {% endif %}
{%    endfor    %}
```






###### Guidelines for Configuration Template

*#Substitution*, Conditioning, and Looping in the Template should be in the Jinja2 standard. For more tutorials, refer to http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.10/.

####### **Points to Remember**

Always enclose the commands within **{% %}** for "if," and "for," and "while" conditional statements

Always enclose the variables inside **{{ }}** for substitution

####### **Sample Template Configuration**

**Example 1:** Create an Empty List, add values to the List, and DO a simple ‘For Loop’

###### Declaring a string variable to store value from *Runtime* or user. The default (“”) function will make the variable empty string till the USER input

Copy

```
{% set myinput = Runtime.interface_list | default(“”) %}
```

###### Converting User Input to a list using the Split function

Copy

```
{% set mylist = myinput .split(",") %}
```

*#Doing* for Loop or Looping of Each Item

Copy

```
{% for each_interface in mylist %}
      <command prompt="#">int {{each_interface}}</command>
      <command prompt="#">shutdown</command>
```

###### for requires *endfor* to close the section

Copy

```
{% endfor %}
```

**Example 2:** Conditions (if case elif Case and else case)

Copy

```
{% for each_interface in mylist %}
        {% if each_interface == "Gi0/1" %}
                  <command prompt="#">int {{each_interface}}</command>
                  <command prompt="#">shutdown</command>
        {% elif each_interface == "Gi0/2" %}
                   <command prompt="#">int {{each_interface}}</command>
                   <command prompt="#">no shutdown</command>
        {% else %}
                    <command prompt="#">I dont know</command>
        {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
```

**Example 3:** Taking List Input from a Trigger

**#down\_interface\_list\_cisco\_ios** is a Trigger in Configuration Trigger

Copy

```
{% set mylist1 = Trigger.down_interface_list_cisco_ios | default([]) %}
{% for each_interface in mylist1 %}
      <command prompt="#">int {{each_interface}}</command>
      <command prompt="#">shutdown</command>
{% endfor %}
```

**Example 4:** Disable the Interface named ‘Ether’

***# String Manipulation startswith, endswith, find, lower, upper, strip***

Copy

```
{% set myinput = Runtime.InterfaceNames | default ("") %}
{% set mylist = myinput.split(",") %}
{% for each_item in mylist %}
      {% if each_item.lower().startswith("ether") %}
            <command prompt="#">int {{each_item}}</command>
            <command prompt="#">shutdown</command>
   {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
```

**Example 5:** Taking the First Element from the Trigger

Copy

```
{% set mylist = Trigger.down_interface_list_cisco_ios |default ([]) %}\

{% if mylist %}
    <command timeout ="10" prompt ="#" >config t</command>
    <command timeout ="10" prompt ="#" >interface {{mylist[0]}} </command>
    <command timeout="10" prompt  ="#" >IP address 172.17.230.2
255.255.255.252</command>
     <command timeout ="10" prompt  ="#" >no shut</command>
{% endif %}
```






###### Add Template

* Click on the (+) icon at the top right corner to add a Configuration Template.
* NCCM supports nine different types of Templates, and each type is used for specific requirements. They are:

  * Command Execution
  * Configuration Merge
  * Configuration Replace
  * Configuration Rollback
  * OS Image Upgrade
  * Network Task Automation
  * NETCONF Merge
  * NETCONF Replace
  * Network Diagnosis
  * HTTP REST-API Configuration
  * Golden Template

####### **Command Execution**

Command Execution is used to execute a series of commands (one by one) on devices, similar to the user executing commands through the Putty application for configuration changes. This template type should be used to change a small set of configurations that do not roll back to previous ones.

Click **"Command Execution"** and click "OK" to proceed further.

* Input the Template Name

  * The template Name should be unique.
* Select the Template Group using the dropdown menu.
* Select Vendor using the dropdown menu.

  * This is mandatory since Template commands are specific to vendor devices.
* Select the OS Type

  * This is mandatory since Template commands are specific to vendor device OS types. If commands are executable on all vendor devices, then input as ALL TYPE.
* Input the Model details.
* Input the Series details.
* Approval Required Checkbox is mandatory, and the user cannot uncheck it. (This is a compliance requirement).
* Input the Template Description.

Click the **"Template Configuration"** panel.

* Select the Configuration Type or Store using the dropdown menu.

  * Supported Types are Startup, Running, and Candidate.
  * This value does not impact the operation but acts as a label for the configuration type that must be changed.
* Click or to load configuration

  * Users can load configurations from existing downloaded versions or the configuration commands from a text file.
  * After loading the configuration commands, the user has to make device-specific changes and create variables to be filled by NCCM during device execution.

Click the **"Access Control"** panel

* Select the visibility

**Note:** If the visibility is “Private,” the User and User group dropdown will be enabled, and the selected user and administrator will only be able to manage this template.

* Select the User(s).
* Select the User group(s).
* Click **"Save"** to save the template with a given input.
* Click **"Cancel"** to abort the Template creation.

Example for Command Execution:

Copy

```
<command prompt=”#”>conf t</command>
<command prompt=”#”>hostname {{Rumtime.xxxx}} </command>
```

####### **Configuration Merge**

Configuration Merge uploads or merges a command block into a Device. This type should be used to create or merge a configuration block into a device.

Click **"Configuration Merge"** and click **"OK"** to proceed further.

* Input the “Configurations to Merge” by directly typing or ‘Loading from Snapshot’ or a file.
* Input the “CLI Commands to Merge.” The CLI Commands will merge the new Configurations into Device Configuration.

**Example Commands to Merge:**

Copy

```
<command prompt="\]\?">copy tftp: running-config</command>
<command prompt="\]\?">{{Global.managementIP}}</command>
<command prompt="\]\?">{{Job.uploadfilename}}</command>
<command previous_match="confirm\]" prompt="#"
timeout="300">yes</command>
<command    action="exit" prompt="">exit</command>
```

**Note:** NCCM will auto-fill the “Configurations to merge commands” into the Job object upload filename variable. The rest of the inputs are similar to *“Add* Command Execution.”

####### **Configuration Replace**

Configuration Replace is used to replace a full configuration into a device. This should replace default or configuration discrepancies with backed-up configuration versions.

Click **"Configuration Replace"** and click **"OK"** to proceed further.

* Input the “Configurations to Replace” by directly typing or Loading from Snapshot or a file.
* Input the “CLI Commands to Replace”. The CLI Commands will replace the new full Configurations with Device Configuration.

**Example Commands to Replace:**

Copy

```
<command    prompt="[\],#]"    timeout="300">configure    replace
tftp://{{Global.managementIP}}/{{Job.uploadfilename}}</command>
<command    previous    match="confirm\]"    prompt="#"
timeout="300">y</command>
<command    action="exit"    prompt="">exit</command>
```

**Note:** NCCM will auto-fill the “Configurations to Replace commands” into the Job object upload filename variable.

The rest of the inputs are similar to “Add [Command Execution](/infraon-help/infinity-user-guide/infraon-configuration/it-operations/network-configuration/configuration-template/add-template#command-execution).”

####### **Configuration Rollback**

Configuration Rollback template will Roll the device configuration back to its previous configuration version.

Click **"Configuration Rollback"** and click **"OK"** to proceed further

* Input the “Configurations to Replace” by loading either from Snapshot or from a file.
* Input the “CLI Commands to Rollback.” The CLI Commands will roll the Device Configuration back to the uploading Configuration version.

**Example Commands to Rollback:**

Copy

```
          <command    prompt="[\],#]" timeout="300">configure replace
           tftp://{{Global.managementIP}}/{{Job.uploadfilename}}</command>
          <command    previous_match="confirm\]" prompt="#"
           timeout="300">y</command>
          <command    action="exit"    prompt="">exit</command>
```

**Note:**NCCM will auto-fill the “Configurations to Rollback commands” into the Job object upload filename variable.

* Users can also Input the following TAGS in “CLI Commands to Rollback” rather than filling in the actual Configuration.

######## **BASELINE-STARTUP-CONFIGURATION**

NCCM will roll back the Baseline Startup configuration of the corresponding device.

######## **PREVIOUS-STARTUP-CONFIGURATION**

NCCM will roll back the previous startup configuration of the corresponding device.

######## **BASELINE-RUNNING-CONFIGURATION**

NCCM will roll back the baseline running configuration of the corresponding device.

######## **PREVIOUS-RUNNING-CONFIGURATION**

NCCM will roll back the previous running configuration for the corresponding device.

**Note: Tags** will be used while Replacing Configurations on multiple devices simultaneously. The rest of the inputs are similar to “Add Command Execution.”

**Note:** Before creating a “Roll Back upload job” or “Auto creation of Rollback Job” from Upload Job Task Result, Configuration Replace templates should be created in NCCM for each vendor & OS Type, and the Template should follow naming standards.

The name of the Replace Template should be

* **“Configuration Rollback To Base -** <Vendor><OS type>”
* **“Configuration Rollback To Previous** - <Vendor><OS type>”

**Example for CISCO IOS**

Configuration Rollback to Base - Cisco-IOS

Configuration Rollback to Previous - Cisco-IOS

**Example for CISCO NXOS**

Infraon NCCM accepts command input only in the regex pattern. Command inputs are split into five sections. They are:

**• Terminate Commands -** Command (sets) denied for execution by the User/User Group. When a user tries these set(s) of commands, Infraon NCCM terminates the CLI Session immediately.

**• Block Commands** - Command (sets) denied for execution by the User/User Group. When a user tries these set(s) of commands, Infraon NCCM blocks these commands from being executed. The CLI session is not terminated here.

**• Notify Commands** - When a user tries these set(s) of commands, Infraon NCCM executes the same and triggers a notification about the action. Notifier (Notification Alert) must be selected using the dropdown menu if this option is selected.

**• Permit Commands** – Command (sets) permitted for execution by the User/User Group. Commands not added in the ‘Permit’ section will be blocked during execution.

**• System Commands** – used to ignore inputs like password and other User credential input. For example, when a user tries to execute a command that requires authentication by the system, the system prompts the user to provide additional information. In this case, a system prompt must be added in the ‘Ignore’ section. If not, the system runs the command through the Permit command list and may block the command/command set.

There are two ways to input commands:

1. Adding commands in the respective text boxes.

2. Importing saved commands from a file. To import commands, click on the respective button:

**Load Terminate Commands from File, Load Block Commands from File, Load Notify Commands from File, Load Permit Commands from File, Load System Commands from File**

##### Generate MD5

This module creates a unique identifier, called an MD5 hash, for each file. Similar to a fingerprint, the MD5 produces a 128-bit hash key that allows administrators to confirm a file's integrity and authenticity. By comparing the generated hash with a known or expected value, they can identify any modifications or corruption that might have happened during file transfers or storage. This function is crucial for maintaining the reliability and security of files within the network management system.

* New OS images will be added whenever an OS image is downloaded from the device.
* OS Images can be downloaded by clicking the OS Image column (OS Images Grid page).

###### **OS Image Download Status**

This feature keeps users informed about operating system downloads for your network devices. It offers real-time updates on the download's progress, whether it's ongoing, finished, stuck in a queue, or encountered errors. Details like Vendor, OS Image, Download Status, Next Action Time, and **Actions (Audits and OS Download Now) can be accessed**.

Monitoring this status is crucial for ensuring successful OS deployments and allows administrators to troubleshoot download issues, guaranteeing devices receive the necessary updates.






###### OS Image Download Scheduler

This module empowers administrators to orchestrate operating system updates for network devices. This feature lets you plan and automate downloads at specific times, often during off-peak hours, to minimize network congestion. By scheduling updates, you can ensure a controlled rollout, prioritize critical devices, and efficiently manage large deployments. Ultimately, the scheduler streamlines network maintenance, boosting overall reliability and reducing the risk of disruptions.

* Once done, click on **“Submit”** to proceed.






##### Configuration Trigger

Configuration Trigger is a pre-processor mainly used to grab information (one or a list of items) from devices or to check if specific configuration or information is available on them. Information collected through Trigger will be imported or used in Configuration Templates as Trigger Objects (similar to Device, Job, Profile, and Global objects) for building device commands dynamically according to the device state.

**LIST example:** If the user wants to add a Configuration to all Interfaces on a device without using Trigger, the user has to specify all interface names in the Runtime object (the user must know the name of interfaces, and names might be different for different type of models). In the case of Trigger, Trigger will execute the command, which will list down all interfaces on the device, parse the interface names from the device response, and store it in a LIST output. The same list can be imported into Template using the Trigger object.

**Boolean example:** If the user wants to enable SNMP Service Configuration on 1000 devices without Trigger, the user must know the details of all those not SNMP enabled and create an Upload Job for those devices. With Trigger, Trigger can execute the “SNMP Service Status” command on all devices, parse the SNMP service status, and store the availability in BOOLEAN output (YES/ NO) for each device. The same BOOLEAN output can be imported back into the Template using the Trigger object to execute the SNMP Enabling command for those devices whose trigger BOOLEAN output value is ‘NO.’

**Note:** Multiple Triggers can be used within a single Configuration Template.

This is a privilege-based feature: The user will be able to access, view, add, edit, delete, execute, and export only if the administrator has given them privileges. This will be defined under roles and privileges.

3. To get a List of Connected Ports
4. To get the List of ACL names

**Note:** In case of the Device not responding or command Error, an empty list will be returned.

**Boolean Trigger** – to get the Boolean value (Yes or No) as the output from the Trigger execution.

1. To check whether BGP Service is enabled.
2. Check whether the SNMP Service is configured.

###### **Add Trigger**

* Navigate to the Configuration Trigger page in the NCCM interface.
* Locate and select the "Add” option to initiate the trigger creation process.

To create a new Configuration Trigger, users can employ one of two methods:

1. Manual Creation
2. CSV Import

| Description | Input a description of the Trigger | Provide clear, concise information about the Trigger's purpose |
| Vendor | Select from available vendors | A trigger should be vendor-specific as it executes device commands |
| OS Name | Select OS Type from the available options | The trigger should be vendor OS Type specific since it executes device commands.When device commands are different for two different OS Types of the same vendor, two different Triggers must be created. |
| Trigger Type | Select LIST or Boolean | Options Include:LIST – for list of Items to be returned.Boolean value – Yes/No. |
| Parser Type | Select from available options | Options include:Column SplitRegex Pattern on all linesPython ScriptRegex Pattern on each LineRegex Pattern on each Line and Column Split.Refer to the Parser Type section for more information |
| Column Index | Input the Column index | Used for Column Split and Regex Pattern on each Line and Column Split |
| Trigger Commands | Input commands to be executed on devices | These commands will check for specific output |
| Parser Text | Input the Parser Text | Used for Pattern matching input (Boolean Type) or as input for Python script |

**Parser Type** | Drop-down list |

**Column Split**

* Will be used for LIST Type only.
* The command output lines will be delimited by white space, and the first column value of all lines will be stored in Trigger Output.

**Regex Pattern on all lines**

* It will be used for Boolean Type only.
* The search Pattern inside “Parser Text” should be matched with any line to get the final output as YES; otherwise, it returns NO.

**Python Script**

* It will be used for both Boolean and LIST Type.
* Python script should be written in “Parser Text.”
* Example Python Parser to get Local Ports on HP Device:

Copy

```
trigger_result = []
found = 0
columns = ["Interface","Link", "Speed","Duplex",
"Type", "PVID", "Description"]
For each_line in trigger_output.split("\n"):
if each_line.split() == columns:
  found = 1
  continue
if found == 1:
  local_port = each_line.split()[0].strIP()
  if local_port.find('/')     !=   -1       and
(local_port.lower().startswith('fe')                        or
local_port.lower().startswith('ge')                        or
local_port.lower().startswith('gi')                         or
local_port.lower().startswith('fi')                          or
local_port.lower().startswith('te')                         or
local_port.lower().startswith('eth')):

trigger_result.append(local_port)

print "trigger_result",trigger_result
```

* The command response will be sent to the Python script in variable trigger\_output.
* The parser output from the Python script will be stored in the variable trigger\_result.

**Regex Pattern on each Line**

* Will be used for Boolean Type only.
* The search Pattern inside “Parser Text” should be matched with all Lines to get the final output as YES else it returns as NO

**Regex Pattern on each Line and Column Split**

* Will be used for LIST Type.
* The search Pattern inside “Parser Text” should be matched with Lines, and matching Lines will be delimited by white space, and the first column value of the lines will be stored in Trigger Output.

Once the details have been added, click on “Next” to continue.

**Test |** Add Trigger |

| Label | Action | Description/ Example |
| --- | --- | --- |

##### Rules

NCCM’s default package includes the following Policy Compliance standards:

However, NCCM allows users to customize the default and add new Compliances using Policy rules and Rule set configurations.

* PCI DSS v3.2
* NIST
* CIS v7
* DISA
* CISP

NCCM rules are defined to ensure security compliance and meet organization standards in the network. Before configuring the change in the network, the user shall check the policy violations of the configurations through a review process to avoid violations. There are four types of rules.

They are:

* Device Configuration Check: The configuration of the device can be checked (Full or Block)
* Network Review: Network Review Check (must be configured first)
* OS Version Check: OS check is performed every day (Default configuration)
* Startup vs. Running: Comparison check between the Baseline and current configuration to detect any discrepancy.

###### **What you see on the screen**

The **Rules** page in NCCM is a privilege-based feature, meaning users can access, view, add, edit, delete, execute, and export rules only if the administrator has assigned the appropriate roles and privileges.

The page displays all the rules available in NCCM and provides several action icons for user interactions:

**Action Icons |** Rules |

| Label | Action | Description |

* If the Rule is private, only those with privileges can view it. The Match criteria will be changed based on the rule type.

**Remedy Action** | Add Rule |

NCCM can also add a rule and remediation action (for when the rule is violated). In case of a rule violation, an alarm trigger and notification can be configured. NCCM supports the configuration of Remediation action, which will be performed automatically.

| Label | Step | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Alarms | | |
| Violation Severity | Select severity from Critical, Major, or Minor | The colour codes (notifiers) are based on the severity of the rule violation selected here. |
| Rule Violation Message | Provide a message about the violated rule. | Give a brief description of the rule violation. For Example, ‘Password not Encrypted’. |
| Notifier | Select the notifier using the dropdown menu. | Select the name of the person who must be notified of the violation. |
| Remediation | | |
| On Violation, Perform | Select the action to be performed when the rule violation is detected. | Based on the rule, the remediation action can be selected. As the above example, NCCM can run a script to encrypt the password. However, there are four action options (as applicable) available on NCCM:Rollback to Baseline – Rolls back the configuration to the baseline configuration.Rollback to Previous – Rolls back the configuration to the previous configuration.Script Execution - Executes the given scriptOS Upgrade - Runs an upgrade for the OS |
| Remediation Comments | Provide comments about the remediation action. | Applicable if rollback is selected in the previous step |
| Continue next Command on Error | Yes/No | If “yes,” the system proceeds with the next set of commands, even if one of the commands throws an error.If “No,” the system stops the execution as and when an error occurs in the command. |

Once all tabs (Rule Information, Match Criteria & Remedy action) have been added, click ‘Save’ to save the Rule. A unique Rule ID is created.

Click ‘Back’ to navigate the Match Criteria tab or ‘Cancel’ to abort the operation.

**Note:** When a Rule is violated, Remediation action is performed by adding a job, i.e., ‘Upload job.’






##### Rule Group

The **Rule Group** is a collection of predefined or newly added rules in NCCM designed to meet specific compliance or operational requirements. While rules define conditions to be checked, a Rule Group allows users to configure device ranges, applicable vendors, and operating systems to which the rules will apply.

Creating a Rule Group involves specifying devices, vendors, and OS versions and associating relevant rules to perform compliance checks. Access to Rule Groups is privilege-based, meaning only users assigned appropriate roles and permissions by the administrator can view, add, edit, delete, execute, or export Rule Groups.

###### **What you see on the screen**

The Rule Group page displays a comprehensive list of all the Rule Groups in NCCM, along with options for filtering and performing quick actions. Below are the available action icons and their descriptions:

**Action Icons |** Rule Group |

| Label | Action | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Search | Locate a specific Rule Group using fields like name, vendor, description, etc. | The search is not case-sensitive and supports partial word matches. For instance, searching for "Net" will return results like "Network." |
| Filter | Apply filters based on specified fields and conditions from the dropdown menu. | Fields include Name, Description, Vendor, OS Name, and Status. Conditions include: in, not in, equal to, not equal to, contains, and does not contain. |
| Add | Create a new Rule Group in NCCM. | It opens a window to define a new Rule Group by configuring devices, vendors, OS, and associated rules. |

##### Download Jobs

Download Job refers to a task that involves retrieving configuration files from network devices such as routers, switches, firewalls, and others and storing them centrally within the system.

The download typically captures the devices' current running configuration and start-up configuration. This job helps IT teams maintain up-to-date backups for disaster recovery, ensure compliance with internal policies, and track any configuration changes over time.

The management admin (user with appropriate privileges) initiates the download process, where network devices can be selected and the configuration type (running or start-up configuration) specified. The tool helps ensure that all configurations are securely backed up, enabling efficient configuration management across multiple devices and vendors.

Infraon's Download Jobs added through the Discovery process or manual Device addition will start downloading:

* Device configurations (Startup & Running - when both are supported by the vendor)
* Operational Data (which can be customized by the administrator)
* Device Inventory Details
* OS image details based on 'Configuration Profile' assigned
* Device Credentials
* Connection & Download protocol selection
* Schedule (daily, weekly, monthly, and Every 'N' days) period

Infraon's Download Job downloads the configurations from devices that support at least one of the management protocols:

* SSHv1
* SSHv2
* TELNET

NETCONF protocol will also be supported in addition to the above protocols to maintain the configuration in XML Format.

Each device will have its own Download job to schedule the download frequency at different intervals.

##### Upload Jobs

Upload jobs involve changing or updating configuration files or firmware from the Infraon NCCM server to network devices. They're commonly used for deploying new devices, updating existing ones, and upgrading device firmware. For instance, users can simultaneously upload entire configuration files or specific snippets to individual or multiple devices.

While backup involves taking a copy of the device configuration and retaining it in the NCCM, upload refers to the opposite. "Upload" transfers the configuration from the NCCM to the device. Entire configuration files or select lines/snippets within a file can be uploaded using the Network Configuration Manager.

*This is a privilege-based feature:* The user can access, view, add, edit, delete, execute, and export only if the administrator has given them privileges. This will be defined under roles and privileges.

Upload jobs are controlled ways of changing the Device Configuration and Device OS Image within a defined period.

The job is routed through the Change Management module for approval. Once approved, the job executes automatically.Note: The Upload Job Pre-Approval setting in Roles and Privileges controls the visibility of this button. |

####### **Change Request Workflow in NCCM**

The **Request** button provides an extra control layer by **routing configuration upload jobs through a formal approval process**. This ensures network changes are reviewed and authorized before being applied to critical infrastructure.

It supports organizations following **ITIL or internal compliance processes**, where technicians or junior admins cannot execute changes directly.

######## **Role-Based Visibility**

The visibility of the **Request** button (and its counterpart, **Submit**) depends on the **Upload Job Pre-Approval** toggle:

| Setting | What Happens |
| --- | --- |
| OFF | Only theRequestbutton is shown. The user must initiate a change request. |
| ON | BothRequestandSubmitbuttons are visible. Privileged users can bypass the approval process and directly submit jobs. |

This setting is configured under the **Roles & Privileges** module.

######## **Request Workflow Process**

1. **Job Creation**
The user fills out the Upload Job details, selects the configuration template and runtime values, then clicks **Request**.

2. **Change Request Generation**
The system automatically generates a **Change Request (CR)** with a unique ID and routes it through the **Change Management** module.

3. **CAB Review and Approval**
The Change Request is assigned to a **CAB team**. It is either approved or rejected based on the defined approval rules (e.g., threshold percentage, approvers).

4. **Job Execution**

* If **approved**, the Upload Job is automatically triggered and executed on the targeted device(s).
* If **rejected**, the job is marked accordingly and is not executed.

5. **Audit and Notification**
All actions are logged for audit purposes. Notifications (if configured) are sent to relevant stakeholders.

Once the details have been added, click on Next to continue.

**Task Details** | Add Upload Jobs

Each Job has one or more tasks to be executed in a specific order, as defined. Task is the smallest unit where command execution on Devices is defined. Every task will have its Configuration Template, and the Devices will RUN with Runtime object input.

Each Task supports multiple command executions with multiple parameter substitutions simultaneously for individual location devices. Every task gets Device Credentials from the User when it is created.

Each task requires the following inputs from the User

* The task waiting Period will suspend the execution of the next Task until the end of the period, at which point the Task execution resumes.
* If the device(s) vendor is not identified (due to SNMP not being reachable), then the upload Job must be selected with Profile, Protocol, and Port to override download Job null entries.
* If any particular task has failed, the task will execute again based on the Retry count and interval before the dependent task execution.
* If the first task fails, the second task will be executed after completing the whole retry interval of the previous task.
* If a task has multiple IP(s) configured and at the time of execution, if any IP(s) fail, the next retry will happen only for the failed IPs.

**Configuring Task Chain or Task Dependency**

The upload job supports Task dependencies by associating ‘Previous Task’s Name’ from the previous task name list and the previous execution result status as a condition for the current task to execute.

Three tasks have been configured:

* Task1 - Enabling the BGP
* Task2 - BGP Additional-Paths Select
* Task3 - Start the Interface
* Task1 is the Parent or Previous Task for the Task2 and Task3.

This will trigger the job to re-execute the same job. However, users cannot re-run a job if any associated tasks are currently in progress or if the job is disabled.






##### Service Template

One or more configuration templates can be configured to create a service template, which is used to fulfill services within NCCM.

This is a privilege-based feature: The user can access, view, add, edit, delete, execute, and export only if the administrator has given them privileges. This will be defined under roles and privileges.

Services are specific to organizations based on the types of services offered. Since service templates are usually a combination of multiple tasks needed to fulfill a service, NCCM does not have default service templates.

Administrators create Service Templates that operators can use.

In **network devices**, a **Service** refers to a specific function or capability that the device provides, such as monitoring, logging, authentication, or automated configuration changes.

In NCCM's Service Template, a **service** defines a structured approach to executing predefined tasks on multiple network devices. It standardizes configurations, updates, and other operations to ensure consistency and efficiency.

**Examples:**

* **Backup Configuration Service** – Periodically saves the current configuration of a device.
* **Firmware Upgrade Service** – Automates the upgrade of the OS or firmware on multiple devices.
* **Compliance Check Service** – Ensures that configurations align with security and operational policies.

Infraon NCCM allows defining five types of command input rules:

Five types of command input options can be defined in an Authorization Profile. They are:

* **Terminate Commands** - Command (sets) denied for execution by the User/User Group. When a user tries these set(s) of commands, Infraon NCCM terminates the CLI Session immediately.

* **Permit Commands** – Command (sets) permitted for execution by the User/User Group. Commands not added in the ‘Permit’ section will be blocked during execution.
* **System Commands** – Used to ignore inputs like password and other User credential input. For example, when a user tries to execute a command that requires authentication by the system, the system prompts the user to provide additional information. In this case, a system prompt must be added in the ‘Ignore’ section. If not, the system runs the command through the Permit command list and may end up blocking the command/command set.

##### ZTP Configuration

This is a privilege-based feature: The user can access, view, add, edit, delete, execute, and export only if the administrator has given them privileges. This will be defined under roles and privileges.

Zero-touch provisioning (ZTP) sets up devices to automate configuration when they initially boot up. It enables IT and network operators to configure networking devices without manual intervention. ZTP (Zero Touch Provisioning) helps IT teams quickly configure devices like network switches, routers, wireless access points, and firewalls in a large-scale environment. It is faster and reduces the chances of human error.

ZTP automates steps like updating operating systems, deploying patches or bug fixes, and implementing added features before connection.

###### **Prerequisites of ZTP**

ZTP process varies for every setup; however, the basic prerequisites are:

* Base/Boot image firmware – All NEs must ship with the default base/boot image, which runs the NEs after initial boot up.
* DHCP Client - The base image firmware should enable the client to broadcast/connect to the DHCP server.
* Telnet/SSH - Should be enabled along with predefined credentials for accepting the remote connection from the NMS Configuration management module, and connectivity
* DHCP Options—Options 60 and 61 for class and client identifier, 55 and sub-list, and 124 list the platform, vendor, serial number, etc.
* Need the base configuration template from the customer/corresponding device’s vendor (Refer to ‘Other Configuration’ tab within configuration profile for details)
* You need to update the ZTP configuration details in the ‘Other Configuration’ tab of the configuration profile (Refer to the ‘Configuration Profile’ section for more information).
* The user must create Device credentials in the NCCM Portal for all the CSR device vendors and models.
* DHCP should send unique content about the new IP assignment in a log/trap/API post.
* All the NEs’ planned IP segments and required ports should be open and reachable from the NCCM module collector instances
* The user must feed the dynamic values from the UI/CSV file upload to update the templates.
* All the NEs’ planned IP segments and required ports should be open and reachable from the NCCM module collector instances
* The user must feed the dynamic values from the UI/CSV file upload to update the templates.

###### **Mapping DORA Process**

The ZTP process relies on a DHCP server to register devices with NCCM. The DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is an external server.

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) uses DORA (Discover, Offer, Request, Acknowledgement). It is an application layer protocol that helps provide an IP address to hosts or client machines. DORA gets the IP address from the centralized server. Whenever new devices are added to the network level and there is no IP in the server or devices, an IP is requested from the DHCP server via DORA.

Once discovered, packets are assigned to the DHCP servers, and one packet is assigned to the added device. Once the DHCP server is reachable from the client, an IP address is requested. The IP is assigned to the device, and it is acknowledged in the acknowledgment packet. This is how DORA works. The DHCP server will take care of the DORA process.

* Listen/Receive the DHCP handshake from NE, which is powered on.
* Provision to assign a Static/Dynamic IP based on the requirement
* Bind the NE’s MAC and the designated IP address for the Static assignment (in case)
* DHCP Classifications Support – based on vendor, location, etc., pool management
* Based on the TLV options and support from Network Equipment
* Preferred Firmware versions
* Option 3 - Default Gateway
* SNMP
* Option 6 - DNS Server
* Option 2, 4 & 42 – Time and NTP server
* Option 66 & 67 Firmware image TFTP/SFTP details (in case NE has a different version)
* Option 82 - relay,
* Logs/Traps/API based notification about new IP Assignment to NMS Server
* Unique content about the new IP assigned along with the MAC address is mandatory. Providing vendor, model, SNMP, and other details as part of the message or on further API queries will be an add-on to complete the ZTP process quickly.






###### ZTP Process Flow

There are multiple steps within ZTP. They are:

####### **Pre-Requisites for ZTP**

Before using ZTP in Infraon NCCM, ensure the following components are configured:

**1. ZTP Configuration Profile**

* Defines how NCCM will interpret syslog messages and which assets can initiate ZTP.
* Includes:

  * **Regex-based Syslog Matching Patterns**
  * **IP Address and MAC Reference Key Patterns**
  * **Device Credential Assignment**
  * **Data Collector Agent**
  * **Optional Notifiers and API Integrations**

**2. Device Credentials**

* Pre-created credential profiles with:

  * **CLI Access** (via SSH or Telnet)
  * **SNMP read/write** community strings for inventory and configuration tasks.

**3. Templates and Runtime Parameters**

* **Configuration Templates** contain reusable command structures with dynamic fields (e.g., ${hostname}, ${ip}).
* **Runtime Parameters** allow populating these fields dynamically per device via:

  * Manual Input
  * CSV Upload
  * External API Query

**4. Role & Privilege Control**

* Admins can directly submit jobs.
* Technicians may only “request” jobs, requiring approval.
* These controls are defined under **Roles and Privileges** in the platform.

**5. Change Management & Approval Setup (if enabled)**

* ZTP jobs can optionally go through **CAB (Change Advisory Board)** review.
* Approval logic, approver teams, and workflows must be preconfigured in the **Change Management module**.

####### **Step-by-Step ZTP Workflow**

**Step 1: Device Power-On**

* A field engineer physically installs the device and powers it on.
* No configuration or IP address exists yet on the device.
* The device must have a **DHCP client** enabled in its base firmware.

**Step 2: DHCP Broadcast and DORA Handshake**

**What is DORA?**
A four-step process of IP assignment using DHCP:

1. **Discover** – Device broadcasts a request to find a DHCP server.
2. **Offer** – DHCP server offers an IP.
3. **Request** – Device confirms it wants the offered IP.
4. **Acknowledge (ACK)** – DHCP confirms the assignment.

* These steps are logged by the DHCP server and forwarded to the **NCCM Agent** for ZTP initiation.

**Step 3: DHCP Syslog Reception & Pattern Matching**

* Infraon NCCM **Agent** listens for logs from DHCP servers.
* **Syslog messages** are matched against patterns defined in ZTP Configuration:

  * .\*DHCPDISCOVER.\*, .\*DHCPACK.\* (to detect IP assignment)
  * MAC address pattern (([0-9A-Fa-f]{2}[:-]){5}([0-9A-Fa-f]{2}))
  * IP address pattern using regex.
* Once matched:

  * A ZTP **event** is triggered in NCCM.
  * This confirms that a new device has come online and can be provisioned.

**Step 4: Event Creation & Device Discovery**

* The system creates a structured **Event Notification** for the new device.
* Based on the ZTP config and privileges:

  * Device discovery is triggered using CLI (SSH/Telnet) or SNMP.
  * If discovery is successful:

    * NCCM retrieves device inventory like hostname, vendor, model, and firmware version.

**Step 5: Template Assignment & Runtime Parameter Mapping**

* Based on the device info or admin selection:

  * A **Configuration Template** is chosen.
* Runtime values (such as hostname, loopback IP, VLANs, etc.) are:

  * Entered manually through UI
  * Uploaded via CSV
  * Retrieved from an external system using **registered APIs**

**Runtime Parameters** must match the template's dynamic fields for successful substitution.

**Step 6: ZTP Upload Job Creation**

* A **ZTP Upload Job** is created to push configurations to the newly discovered device.
* The form displays **two action buttons**:

  * **Submit** – Directly sends the job for execution (requires proper privilege).
  * **Request** – Sends the job for approval via the Change Management process.

Whether **Submit** is available depends on the toggle: Upload Job Pre-Approval.

* **ON** → Submit and Request both visible
* **OFF** → Only Request is visible

**Step 7: Change Management Approval Flow (if enabled)**

When a job is **requested** (instead of submitted), it enters the **Change Request lifecycle**:

**Approval Workflow:**

1. **Change Request Created**: Automatically generated in the **Change Management module**.
2. **Assigned to CAB Team**: Approvers (defined under Teams) are notified.
3. **CAB Members Vote**:

   * Each team member gets the option to *Approve* or *Reject*.
   * Approval thresholds (e.g., 50% or 100%) are enforced.
4. **On Approval**:

   * The job status updates to **Approved**, and execution begins.
5. **On Rejection**:

   * Job status reflects **Rejected**, and no execution occurs.

This ensures audit control for changes made to live environments.

**Step 8: Job Execution**

Once approved (or directly submitted):

* NCCM uses the assigned device credentials to log in.
* Executes the commands as per the configuration template.
* Dynamic values are injected using runtime parameter mapping.
* Job status updates:

  * **Success**
  * **Failed**
  * **Partially Completed** (in case of CLI issues or device mismatch)

**Step 9: Post-Execution Notifications**

After successful execution:

* A notification is sent to:

  * Registered users (e.g., field engineer, support team)
  * API endpoints (e.g., ticketing system, monitoring tool)

Configured via:

* **Notifier Email**
* **API Integration** (using method, endpoint, headers, content type)






##### Runtime Parameter

It allows dynamic configuration customization across devices by injecting parameterized values into reusable configuration templates. These parameters act as **runtime placeholders**, such as **hostname, loopback IP, MAC address,** etc., which get automatically replaced during job execution based on contextual data, without hardcoding device-specific values.

The Runtime Parameter framework offers key benefits such as:

* Template reusability across multiple devices
* Dynamic substitution of device-specific values at execution time
* Flexible input methods through UI, CSV upload, or API integration
* Reduced manual errors by ensuring consistent parameter mapping
* Replacement of legacy script-driven setups with a structured, auditable approach

###### **How Does It Work?**

Runtime Parameters work as **bridge variables** between static templates and real-time configuration needs. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

**1.** **Template Definition**

A configuration template is created using special variables wrapped in **runtime.** format. For example:

**hostname {{Runtime.hostname}}**
**ip address {{Runtime.loopback\_ip}} 255.255.255.0**

**2.** **Mapping Runtime Parameters**

These variables must be mapped to actual values for each device. The Runtime Parameter module does this, and it stores the values either per device or per profile.

**3.** **Parameter Input Methods**

* **Manual Entry**: Technicians can input values via the UI during job setup.
* **CSV Upload**: Bulk upload of values for multiple devices using a predefined CSV format.
* **API Integration**: Values fetched automatically from third-party systems like IPAM, CMDB, etc.

**4.** **Job Execution**

During the job run (Upload Job or ZTP), the NCCM engine parses the template and locates the runtime variables, substituting them with the mapped values.

**5.** **Fallback or Validation**

If a runtime variable is missing:

* The system can pause for input (if enabled)
* Skip that section
* Or fail the job (depending on configuration)

###### **What Do You See on the Screen**

It provides a tabular view of all parameter mappings associated with configuration templates and profiles.

Each row represents a runtime parameter mapped to a specific IP address and configuration profile. Users can **add parameters manually, import in bulk using CSV**, or **edit/delete existing mappings**.

[Log Rule](/infraon-help/infinity-user-guide/infraon-configuration/it-operations/rules/log-rule)[Correlation Rule](/infraon-help/infinity-user-guide/infraon-configuration/it-operations/rules/correlation-rule)






##### Log Rule

A robust Infraon Infinity solution must monitor certain events in real-time to facilitate swift responses to security threats. Log rules are essential components that define how log data is processed, examined, and acted upon within logging and monitoring systems.

**Note:** Ensure you have the appropriate permissions before creating or modifying alerts.

Infraon's alerting system allows you to set up rules that continuously scan log data for specific conditions. When these conditions are met, the system triggers predefined alerts.

In essence, rules are predetermined scenarios that, when matched, initiate an alarm, event, or configured action. Each rule consists of three key elements:

* A specific query to be executed
* Parameters that determine what constitutes a rule match
* A set of alerts to be triggered when a match occurs

###### **Rule Types:**

Infraon Infinity allows you to set up rules that can trigger alarms or send notifications to users through email or SMS. These rules are based on specific criteria you define, such as error rate thresholds or particular log patterns. The system offers two main types of rules:

####### **Custom Query**

Custom query rules use tailored search parameters to identify alert-worthy conditions in your log data. To set up a custom query rule:

* Formulate a query that filters the log data you want to monitor
* Design the query to capture the exact conditions that should trigger an alert
* Specify how often the system should run this query to check for matching log entries (e.g., every 5 minutes)

####### **Threshold Rule**

Activates when defined thresholds are reached. Select the metric or data point for monitoring. For instance, you could track the number of error logs or the average response time. Establish the alert triggers, such as limits for high error frequencies or unexpected data surges.

* Trigger Condition: For example, if the error tally reaches over 100 in 5 minutes.
* Alert Frequency: The regularity of condition assessment (e.g., every 5 minutes).

###### **Instructions to add a New Log rule**

* Go to Infraon configuration -> IT Operations -> Rules and click on the ‘New Rule’ button at the top right corner and Add Log rule option to continue.
* Refer to the table below to add the details respectively.

**Add Log Rule** | Details

| Alarm/ Event Message | Enter a personalized notification text that will appear in the event when the rule is triggered. | |

Once the details have been added, click “Save” to confirm the rule configurations.






##### Correlation Rule

###### **Topology Correlation**

Topology-based correlation uses topology data to correlate defined related events. It is a solution that uses topology-based techniques to provide automated root cause analysis, service impact analysis, and customer impact analysis. It helps network operators identify the root causes of issues and quickly determine the services and customers affected by network events.

###### **Event Based Correlation Rule**

Event correlation refers to the processes involved in sensing and analyzing relationships between events. By correlating the parent and child events occurring in the network, event correlation automatically reduces the noise and allows IT to focus on those issues that really matter to the business service and IT objectives.

###### **Instructions to add a new correlation rule**

* Go to Infraon configuration -> IT Operations -> Rules and click on the ‘New Rule’ button at the top right corner and select Correlation Rule.
* Add the respective Correlation Rule Details, select the criteria and add the action details.

####### **What you see on the screen**

Once you've filled in all the information, click the "Submit" button to save your credentials.






#### Thresholds

Infraon allows users to define health indexes to monitor the network's performance. Thresholds play an essential role in tracking the fault and performance of devices and detecting faults and performance-based alerts. These faults and performance are indicated using severity levels as follows:

* Critical: Indicated in Red
* Major: Indicated in Orange
* Minor: Indicated in Yellow
* Informational: Indicated in Green

Furthermore, there are two state-based indicators which are:

* Unknown/Dependent: Indicated in Blue – when the parent/primary device is down, the dependent/Child device’s status is unknown.
* Under Maintenance: Indicated in Grey, this is when a device/node is placed under maintenance for a planned outage.

Thresholds can be defined for any monitoring KPI (Key Performance Indicators). Infraon is configured with built-in (global) thresholds for all the monitoring nodes and their components. Based on these thresholds, users can quickly spot resources that require attention even before thresholds are breached.

Default threshold configuration covers important indicators like:

* CPU Utilization
* Memory Utilization
* Disk Utilization
* Latency
* Packet Loss
* Network Bandwidth Utilization
* BGP Status
* Error Rate
* Discard Rate
* Process CPU Usage
* Process Memory Usage

Infraon offers multiple threshold configurations where the administrator can configure threshold settings for a specific resource or as a group. Infraon allows the user to define the following:

* Set Point
* Reset Point
* Set Message
* Reset Message
* Set Alarm Hold Time
* Reset Alarm Hold Time
* Severity

##### **Alarm Condition Logic**

**For the positive polarity parameters:**

If the Current Value is > Set Point, the node/device gets into an alarm state and continues to be in an alarm state until the value <= Reset Point.

**For the negative polarity parameters:**

If the Current Value is < Set Point, the node/device gets into an alarm state and continues to be in an alarm state until the value >= Reset Point.

In addition to the standard/global thresholds across the network, the Adaptive/Dynamic threshold or baseline helps determine the performance issue of every component within the network based on its performance benchmarks and expectations. It helps eliminate unwanted alerts, thus resulting in focused business operations. Infraon UNMS supports an ML-based algorithm for auto-baselining thresholds for various performance metrics.

Thresholds are mainly for Performance metrics such as Traffic Utilization, Latency, Jitter, CPU Utilization, Memory Utilization, Temperature, etc. Users can define multiple thresholds with different severity levels for a single monitoring parameter. For e.g.,

CPU Utilization Thresholds can be defined as follows:

If CPU Utilization > 50%, severity is ‘Minor’

If CPU Utilization > 75%, severity is ‘Major’

If CPU Utilization > 90%, severity is ‘Critical’

##### **What you see on the screen**

This page displays the list of predefined thresholds on Infraon. We recommend you not make any changes to the default values. However, these values can be edited or deleted using the action icon on each line item. Information display includes:

##### AIOps Configuration

###### **Adaptive Thresholds**

These dynamic, model-generated values define acceptable upper and lower bounds for system metrics hourly. These thresholds are not fixed like traditional static thresholds (e.g., CPU > 80%) but are derived from **30 days of historical data** to predict the expected range of values for the next **three weeks**. The model calculates and maintains three key values for each hour: **lower bound, upper bound, and median value**.

**Example:**

The model learns this trend for a router port with low typical usage on Mondays at 11 AM. If a sudden spike is observed at that same hour, it will flag it as an anomaly based on the trained range threshold, not a hardcoded static rule.

####### **Add or Configure Range Thresholds**

* Go to Infraon Configuration -> IT Operations-> Threshold
* Click on 'Add' and select 'Protocol' as desired.

Please refer to the [product documentation](/infraon-help/infinity-user-guide/infraon-configuration/it-operations/thresholds#instructions-to-add-a-threshold)for guidance on adding Basic threshold types.

######## Model-Based Thresholding

* The system requires **30 days of historical data** to analyze usage trends.
* Once enough data is available, the model generates **hourly range values** for the next **2 weeks**.
* For each hour, the model calculates:

  * **Lower bound**
  * **Upper bound**
  * **Median value**
* These values are collectively known as the **Range Threshold** and are used for anomaly detection.

**Add Range | Basic Details**

| Label | Action | Description / Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Severity | Select the severity level. | Choose the alert severity (e.g., Minor, Major, Critical) to define the threshold range for each level. |
| Condition | Select from the drop-down | Defines the condition type.
Options include:· Greater Than or Equal To (≥)· Less Than or Equal To (≤) |
| Value | Enter a numeric value | Specify the threshold value to compare against the monitored metric.
Example: 100000000. |
| Poll Points | Enter a numeric value. | Number of polling intervals (data points) to be considered for evaluating the condition.
Example: 10 |
| Breached (%) | Enter a percentage value | Percentage of poll points that must breach the defined value to trigger an alert.
Example: 60% |
| Effective Poll Points | Auto-calculated (read-only) | The actual number of poll points that need to breach the threshold.
Calculated as: Poll Points × Breach%
Example: 10 poll points × 60% = 6 effective poll points. |

######## Enabling Adaptive Thresholds

* In the configuration UI for Advanced Resource Configuration, toggle **Prediction** and set the necessary statistical inputs.
* The system will apply the model-generated thresholds automatically.
* These thresholds adjust for:

  * Time of day (e.g., weekday vs weekend behavior)
  * Device-specific patterns
  * Location-specific variations

######## Threshold Sensitivity (Factor Configuration)

* You can optionally define **severity levels** (e.g., Minor, Major, Critical) based on how much the live value deviates from the predicted range.
* The formula used:

  * `Threshold = Model Value ± (Factor × Deviation)`
  * For example, if the predicted upper band is 70 and the factor is 1 with a margin of 20, the threshold would extend to 90.
* This helps adjust thresholds based on how aggressively you want to treat deviations as anomalies.

**Adaptive Threshold** | Basic Details

| Label | Action | Description / Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Severity | Select the severity level. | Define the alert severity (e.g., Minor, Major, Critical) to configure threshold behavior accordingly for each level. |
| Factor | Enter a numeric value | Multiplier used to scale the deviation from the model’s predicted value. It determines how sensitive the threshold is.Example:If the predicted value is 70 and the deviation is 10, a factor of1.5means the threshold will be set at70 ± (1.5 × 10) = 55 to 85. |
| Upper Band | Enter the factor and alert above value. | Upper Band: Specifies how many times above the predicted upper bound the breach should be considered.
Alert Above: A fallback value above which a breach is triggered. |
| Lower Band | Enter the factor and alert below the value. | Lower Band: Defines how many times below the predicted lower bound a value must fall to trigger a breach.
Alert Below: The fallback value below is where the breach applies. |
| Poll Points | Enter a numeric value. | The number of polling intervals (data points) to evaluate for the defined severity level. |
| Breached (%) | Enter a percentage value | The percentage of poll points must breach the threshold to raise an alert. |

Customizations Available:

* You can choose which threshold bands to apply: **Upper only**, **Lower only**, or **Both**.
* Configure point tolerance by specifying how many consecutive breaches (e.g., **3 out of 5 poll points**) should trigger an alert.

Usage in Real-Time Monitoring:

* During live monitoring, the system compares each **polled value** against the model's predicted upper and lower thresholds.
* An anomaly event is generated if a value falls outside the defined range.
* The anomaly event can automatically create a ticket if a corresponding trigger is configured.
* Threshold models are **retrained weekly** to adapt to the latest usage patterns.






#### Seasonal Event Interface

This interface helps detect **repetitive or expected downtimes** by analyzing historical event data over a defined period. This module enables users to fine-tune event handling and suppress alerts that do not require operational attention by identifying patterns such as weekly device shutdowns or routine maintenance windows.

##### **What Do You See on the Screen**

This view-only interface presents recurring downtime patterns across selected assets and resources. Users can apply filters (Asset, Resource, Statistic, Time Range) to analyze suppression candidates based on frequency, duration, and matching time windows.

Suppression logic must be configured through the ARC (Advanced Resource Configuration) module.

### Log Management

Logging is an integral part of IT infrastructure management and process. Logs are generated from Routers, Switches, firewalls, IDS/IPS, Servers, Databases, and Web Servers across the IT infrastructure. They can be a generic live status of the end system or a detailed log of the running processes.

Log Management, a part of Infraon Infinity, helps in real-time analysis that can be used for security, compliance, audit, and IT operations.

Log Management enables reacting to anomalies based on log events and patterns, which play a crucial role in application troubleshooting, business analytics, marketing insights, resource management, and regulatory compliance.

#### Access Control

This guide is intended only for Infraon Infinity operators/users with access based on selected roles and privileges assigned by the administrator.

Access depends on the type of license purchased by the portal operator.

**Note:** The administrator drafted this document after accessing all the operator/user portal modules.

Administrators are responsible for adding or editing user roles and privileges to manage logs. Similar to other modules, specific roles will be configured for the Log Management module. The log management system will update These roles and permissions to ensure appropriate access control.

Users can log in with the assigned credentials and perform tasks within the Log Management module based on their privileges and permissions. Access to various features within the module will depend on the Roles and Privileges the administrator enables. (Click here to view the guide on how to add or edit users with specific roles and permissions.)

#### How does it work?

Log management collects, stores, analyses, and monitors log data generated by systems, applications, and services within an IT infrastructure. This module will log assets uploaded to our system.

This module enables users to access network device logs via the Syslog server. For Windows-specific logs, utilize the Winlog beat server. To collect Linux logs, employ the file beat server.

Logs will be saved in the elastic database, and log stash can be used as a pipeline to dump data into it.

Log Management will fetch data from the elastic database and show it in the Infraon interface based on configuration.

Monitoring, documenting, and analyzing system events are crucial to security intelligence (SI). Regarding compliance, regulations such as PCI have specific mandates relating to audit logs.

Log management software automates many of the processes involved. For example, an event log manager (ELM) tracks organizational IT infrastructure changes. These changes are reflected in audit trails that must be produced for a compliance audit.

#### Log Management Sub-modules:

**Log Multi-Index:** Create and manage the multi-indexes that help retrieve data from Elasticsearch.

**Log Search:** Provide options to quickly search and filter the logs and get information about the field's structure.

**Log Stream:** Provide a way to visualize and analyze log data in real-time.

**Export Configs:** Export Configs define how logs are exported, including format, size, and download of the generated log files.

Let’s see each one in detail:






#### Log Multi-Index

The Log Multi-Index feature allows users to configure and manage log indices in a structured way. It creates a unified view of similar indices, enabling efficient storage and retrieval of log data within the system.

Log indices are collections of patterns that link the log management server with the data stored in Elasticsearch. Users can define how the system interprets and displays log data by configuring index patterns. This module allows users to add, edit, or delete indices as needed.

Each index name follows a structured format based on the timestamp, which helps organize logs efficiently.

Copy

```
Example: windows-yyyy.mm.dd
```

To retrieve logs for the last three days, users can select the relevant index patterns to create a comprehensive data view.

Copy

```
Example: windows-2024.09.03, windows-2024.09.04, and windows-2024.09.05
```

Users can use wildcard patterns to retrieve logs for multiple days or all related indices.

Copy

```
Example: windows* groups all Windows-related indices.
```

The multi-index generated will include default fields such as:

* host.ip
* host.id
* host.name

Additionally, users can customize the columns displayed on the log search page for each index to ensure relevant data is easily accessible.

##### **What do you see on the screen?**

Refer to the table below for the information shown on the Multi-Index page:

**Multi-Index Details** | Fields

**Note:** While filling out the form, users can see a preview section adjacent to the input fields. This preview updates in real-time, allowing users to see how their custom field will appear and make adjustments accordingly.

After entering all the required information, click the 'Save' button to finalize and apply your custom field configuration.






#### Log Search

The Log Search module is a powerful tool designed to help users efficiently navigate and analyze large volumes of structured and unstructured log data. The Log Search feature addresses this challenge by enabling quick and effective searching across extensive log collections, providing results within seconds.

At its core, the Log Search queries and analyzes log data stored in the Elastic database. The module's architecture is built on index-based storage, where logs are structured, grouped, and stored based on index values. This approach allows efficient searching across specific log categories, significantly reducing search times and improving overall performance.

##### **What do you see on the screen?**

The log search page presents the data distribution of documents over time. A table lists the fields for each document matching the current data view. To narrow down the results, you can apply filters and customize the table to show only the fields you wish to explore.

**Log Search Details | Fields**

| Label | Action/ Description |
| --- | --- |
| Top Panel | |
| Data View | Select the type of Data view that needs to be present on the Log search page. |
| Query Menu | The query menu lets you save queries, including text, filters, and time ranges, for reuse across any query bar. For example, after building a query in Log Search with custom inputs, filters, and a time range, you can save it by embedding it in dashboards, creating visualizations, or sharing results via link or CSV. Saved queries also store Log Search settings like selected columns, sort order, and data view, making them ideal for adding search results to a dashboard. |
| Add Filter | Click to add a new filter based on Fields (@timestamp, @version, etc.), operator, and value. |
| Search | Click to search for particular multi-Index data using your KQL syntax. |
| Time Range | Easily adjust the time range of your time-based data by using the Calendar icon to select quick, preset, or custom time ranges, with options to refresh data automatically.(Refer to the section below for more details) |
| Refresh | This refreshes a local multi-index field list. |
| Download | Users can generate a report for the Multi-Index created by clicking on the download section. Once the exported logs are generated in the Logs Export Configs module, they can be downloaded. The report, including the generated logs, will be available in PDF, CSV, and XLS formats. |

###### **Adjusting the Time Range**

If your index contains time-based events and a time field is configured for the selected multi-index, you can display data within a specific time range. The time range is set to 15 minutes by default, but you can modify it to suit your needs.

* Click the **Calendar** icon located on the top panel.
* Choose from the following options:

  * **Quick select:** Set a time range based on a specific number of seconds, minutes, hours, or other units in the past or future.
  * **Commonly used:** Select a preset time range, such as the last 15 minutes, Today, or Week-to-date.
  * **Recently used date ranges:** Reapply a previously selected time range.
  * **Refresh every:** Set an automatic refresh interval for the data.
* To customize the start and end times, click the bar next to the time filter. In the popup, choose between **Absolute**, **Relative**, or **Now** and configure the options as needed.

###### **Modify the Document Table**

You can adjust the appearance and content of the document table by resizing columns and rows, sorting fields, and applying filters to refine your document view.

###### **Reorder and Resize Columns**

* To move a single column, click its header and select "Move left" or "Move right" from the dropdown menu.
* To rearrange multiple columns, click "Columns," then drag and drop column names in the pop-up to reorder them.
* To resize a column, drag the right edge of the column header until it reaches the desired width.

**Adjust Row Height** Click the row height icon (displayed as a table icon) to set the row height to either one or more lines or automatically adjust it to fit the content.

**Sort Fields** Data can be sorted by one or more fields in ascending or descending order. By default, sorting is based on the time field, from newest to oldest.

* To sort a single field, click its column header and select the sort order.
* To sort by multiple fields, click "Field sorted," choose the fields from the dropdown, and add them.
* To reorder fields in the sort, drag them to the desired position.

**Edit a Field** You can modify how Infraon Infinity displays a field:

* Click the column header for the field and select "Edit data view field."
* In the "Edit field" form, change the field name and format as needed.

**Filter Documents** You can filter documents to focus on the specific data you're interested in:

* Select the documents you wish to compare.
* Click the "Documents selected" option and select "Show selected documents only."

**Set Rows per Page** To adjust how many rows are displayed per page, use the "Rows per page" menu. The default setting is 100 rows per page.

**Inspect a Document** You can explore an individual document to view its fields, apply filters, and review documents that occurred before or after it:

* Click the expand icon (a double arrow) next to a document in the list.
* You can view the document in two formats:

  * **Table View**: Displays fields and values in a row-by-row format.
  * **JSON View**: Shows how the document is returned from Elasticsearch.
* In Table View, hover over the Actions column to:

  * Filter results to include or exclude specific fields or values.
  * Toggle a field on or off in the document table.
  * Pin a field to keep it at the top.
* To navigate to the next or previous document, use the < and > arrows at the top of the view.
* Click "Single document" to create a bookmarkable and shareable view of a document. The link will remain valid if the document is available in Elasticsearch.
* To view documents before or after the current event, click "Surrounding documents." The same columns and filters from the Log search view will apply, with pinned filters remaining active and others copied in a disabled state.






#### Log Stream

The Log Stream in Infraon Infinity allows you to search, filter, and tail all logs ingested into the Elasticsearch database without logging into different servers, changing directories, or tailing individual files. All your logs are conveniently accessible within the Log Stream.

Features include live log streaming, filtering with auto-complete, and a log graph for efficient navigation. You can also quickly categorize log messages to identify patterns in your log events.

##### **What do you see on the screen?**

**Add Log Source**: Provide details such as source type, connection information, and any required authentication to specify new log sources.

**Edit Log Source**: Update the configuration of existing log sources if source details or connection parameters change.

**Remove Log Source**: Delete a log source that is no longer needed or is causing issues.

**Log Columns Customization**

* Users can adjust the columns displayed in log entries to fit their needs better. This includes adding new fields for more detailed log information or removing obsolete ones.

**Add New Field**: Introduce new columns to the log entries by defining field names and specifying their types. This feature helps capture additional data points that may be relevant for analysis.

**Delete Existing Field**: Remove any necessary or relevant fields that are no longer necessary to streamline log data presentation.

**Note:** Only users with the appropriate privileges can change the Log Stream Settings page.






#### Export Configs

Exporting logs or data from Log management can be useful for offline analysis, reporting, or sharing with others. Infraon Infinity provides a few data export methods, including PDF, Excel, and CSV.
